    "- ePost - Accepts a list of UIDs from a given database, stores the set on the History Server, and responds with a query key and web environment for the uploaded dataset.\n",
    "- efetch - Retrieves records in the requested format from a list of one or more primary IDs or from the user’s environment\n",
    "- elink  - Checks for the existence of an external or Related Articles link from a list of one or more primary IDs. Retrieves primary IDs and relevancy scores for links to Entrez databases or Related Articles; creates a hyperlink to the primary LinkOut provider for a specific ID and database, or lists LinkOut URLs and Attributes for multiple IDs.\n",
    "- eSummary - Retrieves document summaries from a list of primary IDs or from the user’s environment.\n",
    "- egQuery - Provides Entrez database counts in XML for a single search using Global Query.\n",
    "- eSpell - Retrieves spelling suggestions.\n",
    "- eCitmatch - Retrieves PubMed IDs (PMIDs) that correspond to a set of input citation strings.\n",

In person cognition, research has focused on the roles of gender, race, age or appearance in social categorical thinking. Here we investigated how narrative roles, as portrayed by different cinematic characters, are categorized in the neurocognitive system. Under functional MRI, 17 human participants (7 females) were asked to make different judgements regarding personality traits of 16 renowned cinematic characters representing four roles: hero, sidekick, mentor and villain. Classification analysis showed a brain network, comprising the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus and the temporoparietal junction bilaterally and the left occipital face area (OFA), to discriminate between the four roles. No such classification was found between other individual attributes including age or the associated film. Moreover, regions overlapping the default mode network (DMN) were found to better discriminate between roles, rather than the individual characters, while the OFA was found to better discriminate between individuals. These results demonstrate the inherent role of roles in person cognition, and suggest an intimate relation between roles categorization and self-referential activity.<b>Significance statement:</b>Social categorization, the assignment of different people in our social network to subgroups, is a powerful strategy in social cognition. How is this managed by the brain? We provide evidence that different characters from different stories, representing similar roles in their corresponding narrative, elicit similar brain activation patterns, as revealed by functional MRI. Unlike previous studies of social categorization, these brain activations were similar to those elicited by social cognition rather than face processing, and included regions at the prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the temporoparietal junction. The identified brain network significantly overlapped the default mode network (DMN). We suggest that social categorization by roles is fundamental to the cognitive system, relying on brain regions related to social cognition.\"Every man acts the part assigned to him-by himself or others-in this life.\" (Luigi Pirandello, 1921).</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 the authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN=\"Y\"><Author

auditory threat memory and perceptual decisions remain uncertain to date. Candidates include the primary (A1) and secondary (A2) auditory cortex, the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGm), amygdala, and the temporal association cortex (TeA). We used chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations with <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> patch-clamp recordings to assess the roles of these brain regions in threat memory learning in female mice. We found that conditioned sound (CS) frequency-dependent plasticity resulted in the formation of auditory threat memory in the TeA. This neural correlated auditory threat memory depended on CS frequency information from A1 glutamatergic subthreshold monosynaptic inputs, CS lateral inhibition from A2 glutamatergic disynaptic inputs, and non-frequency-specific facilitation from MGm glutamatergic monosynaptic inputs. These results indicate that the A2 and MGm work together in an inhibitory-facilitative role.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>The ability to recognize specific sounds in order to avoid predators or seek prey is a useful survival tool. Improving this ability through experiential learning is an added advantage requiring neural plasticity. As an example, humans must learn to distinguish the sound of a car horn, and thus to avoid oncoming traffic. Our research discovered that the TeA can encode this kind of auditory information through tonal receptive field plasticity. In addition, the results revealed the underlying synaptic mechanisms of this process. These results extended our understanding of how meaningful auditory information is processed in an animal\\'s brain.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 the

motion-sensitive midtemporal area on perceptual-cognitive skills (visuomotor and basketball decision-making skills) in mentally fatigued basketball players. A total of 20 male basketball players were recruited. This was a randomized, double-blinded, and counterbalanced crossover study with two experimental conditions: a-tDCS and Sham. The participants completed the basketball decision-making task and visuomotor skill after performing a 60-min sport-based videogame task with anodal (i.e.,\\xa0a-tDCS) or placebo (Sham) stimulation over the motion-sensitive middle temporal area. Worse response time was observed in visuomotor skill for Sham than a-tDCS postexperiment (p &lt; .05). There was no main condition effect for accuracy of visuomotor skill (p &gt; .05). There was more impairment in accuracy and response time in basketball decision-making skills for the Sham condition than a-tDCS (p &lt; .05). Notably, a-tDCS over the motion-sensitive middle temporal area removed the negative effects of mental fatigue on perceptual-cognitive skills.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList

The BHC was revised to include mental health to provide a holistic approach to workplace health. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the revised BHC by comparing the results around psychological distress and future risk with previous research, and a participant feedback survey.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHOD\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Data collection took place between October 2018 and May 2019. The study used data that were collected as part of programme delivery, as well as a participant feedback survey that was administered after the health check was completed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">BHCs were completed by n=912 workers, out of which, n=238 completed the feedback survey. The mean Distress Questionnaire 5 score was 10.5, and 10% of participants met the threshold for \\'high\\' future risk. The feedback survey revealed that the majority of participants found the mental health advice to be useful (76%), agreed with their mental health distress and risk ratings (92%-94%) and most intended on using the referred services (62%-68%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The findings around mental health risk were comparable to previous findings in employed samples. The inclusion of mental health assessments, advice and referral pathways into the BHC was found to be acceptable and the subsequent referrals were appropriate, indicating that this approach could be scaled up and implemented to help address worker\\'s mental ill health.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

In this study, the full-length GS was cloned from the liver of yellow catfish. The full-length cDNA sequence of GS was 1928 bp in length and encoded 371 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of GS showed high homology (99%) with that of channel catfish. The highest mRNA expression of GS was found in the brain of yellow catfish. Acute ammonia stress (96\\u202fh LC50) significantly increased ammonia levels in plasma, liver, and brain, and GS gene expression was significantly up-regulated in the liver and brain. RNA interference inhibited the GS mRNA expression level in primary cultured hepatocytes after acute ammonia stress and reduced hepatocyte survival rate. It is suggested that GS plays a key role in ammonia detoxification in yellow catfish by regulating glutamine synthesis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022.

Pathological condition of anxiety elicits defensive behavior and aversive reaction ultimately impacting individuals and society. The gut microbiota has been shown to contribute to the modulation of anxiety-like behavior in rodents through the gut-brain axis. Several studies observed that germ-free (GF) and the broad spectrum of antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-treated rodents display lowered anxiety-like behavior. We speculate that gut microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) modulate the innate anxiety response. Herein, we administered SCFA in the drinking water in adult mice treated with ABX to deplete the microbiota and tested their anxiety-like behaviors. To further augment the innate fear response, we enhanced the aversive stimulus of the anxiety-related behavior tests. Strikingly, we found that the anxiety-like behavior in ABX mice was not altered when enhanced aversive stimulus, while control and ABX mice supplemented with SCFA displayed increased anxiety-like behavior. Vagus nerve serves as a promising signaling pathway in the gut-brain axis. We determined the role of vagus nerve by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) in ABX mice supplemented with SCFA. The restored anxiety-like behavior in ABX mice by SCFA was unaffected by SDV. These findings suggest that gut microbiota can regulate anxiety-like behavior through their fermentation products SCFA.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022.

Traditionally, rodent BBB permeability increase is determined by measuring cerebral leakage of certain dyes such as Evans Blue or sodium fluorescein (NaFL). However, due to the special processing of samples for BBB permeability measurement, they cannot be used afterward for determining other essential parameters such as cerebral infarction volume. Therefore, using different batches of animals for assessing BBB permeability and infarction volume is typical. However, this would limit the stroke study\\'s statistical power and scientific value while hindering the implementation of procedures for high standard animal welfare.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"NEW METHOD\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">The rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were intraperitoneally injected with NaFL during the reperfusion phase. The brains were sliced and measured for BBB permeability using the small animal optical imaging system (IVIS® Lumia series III). Afterward, the same brain samples were either sliced or homogenized for tests that assessed infarction volume or other molecular changes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">The sum fluorescence intensity of the ischemic brain slices under the IVIS® Lumia series Ⅲ showed a strong correlation with the infarction volume determined by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining (r = 0.7440, P = 0.0087). The fluorescence intensity of the whole ischemic brain was correlated with the NaFL concentration of brain tissue homogenates (r = 0.8653, P = 0.0026) and cerebral infarction volume (r = 0.7282, P = 0.0072).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">The new method enables concurrent measurement of BBB permeability and infarction volume on the same batch of brain tissue samples without affecting most downstream biochemical assays.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">By applying the new method, we could use the same batch of ischemic rodent brain tissue for multiple assays, including BBB permeability and infarction volume. Through this, we would reduce the animal numbers in each study and help to maximize the scientific and statistical potential of future rodent ischemic studies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022.

We investigate how a lineage-specific transcription factor, Acj6, controls the precise dendrite targeting of Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) by regulating the expression of cell-surface proteins. Quantitative cell-surface proteomic profiling of wild-type and acj6 mutant PNs in intact developing brains, and a proteome-informed genetic screen identified PN surface proteins that execute Acj6-regulated wiring decisions. These include canonical cell adhesion molecules and proteins previously not associated with wiring, such as Piezo, whose mechanosensitive ion channel activity is dispensable for its function in PN dendrite targeting. Comprehensive genetic analyses revealed that Acj6 employs unique sets of cell-surface proteins in different PN types for dendrite targeting. Combined expression of Acj6 wiring executors rescued acj6 mutant phenotypes with higher efficacy and breadth than expression of individual executors. Thus, Acj6 controls wiring specificity of different neuron types by specifying distinct combinatorial expression of cell-surface executors.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we constructed a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across aged tissues/organs and their rejuvenation in heterochronic parabiosis (HP), a classical model to study systemic aging. In general, HP rejuvenated adult stem cells and their niches across tissues. In particular, we identified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as one of the most responsive cell types to young blood exposure, from which a continuum of cell state changes across the hematopoietic and immune system emanated, through the restoration of a youthful transcriptional regulatory program and cytokine-mediated cell-cell communications in HSPCs. Moreover, the reintroduction of the identified rejuvenating factors alleviated age-associated lymphopoiesis decline. Overall, we provide comprehensive frameworks to explore aging and rejuvenating trajectories at single-cell resolution and revealed cellular and molecular programs that instruct systemic revitalization by blood-borne factors.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, how such gradual changes in higher-order genome organization impinge on local epigenetic modifications to drive cellular mechanisms of aging has remained enigmatic. Here, through large-scale epigenomic analyses of isogenic young, senescent, and progeroid human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hMPCs), we delineate a hierarchy of integrated structural state changes that manifest as heterochromatin loss in repressive compartments, euchromatin weakening in active compartments, switching in interfacing topological compartments, and increasing epigenetic entropy. We found that the epigenetic de-repression unlocks the expression of pregnancy-specific beta-1 glycoprotein (PSG) genes that exacerbate hMPC aging and serve as potential aging biomarkers. Our analyses provide a rich resource for uncovering the principles of epigenomic landscape organization and its changes in cellular aging and for identifying aging drivers and intervention targets with a genome-topology-based mechanism.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we use Chrna2-Cre mice to characterize striatal interneurons (INs) expressing the nicotinic α2 receptor subunit. Using triple patch-clamp recordings combined with optogenetic stimulations, we characterize the electrophysiological, morphological, and synaptic properties of striatal Chrna2-INs. Striatal Chrna2-INs have diverse electrophysiological properties, distinct from their counterparts in other brain regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. Unlike in other regions, most striatal Chrna2-INs are fast-spiking INs expressing parvalbumin. Striatal Chrna2-INs are intricately integrated in the striatal microcircuit, forming inhibitory synaptic connections with striatal projection neurons and INs, including other Chrna2-INs. They receive excitatory inputs from primary motor cortex mediated by both AMPA and NMDA receptors. A subpopulation of Chrna2-INs responds to nicotinic input, suggesting reciprocal interactions between this GABAergic interneuron population and striatal cholinergic synapses.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Most therapies rarely provide clinically meaningful outcomes in the treatment of GBM. Although antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising anticancer drugs, no ADCs have been clinically successful for GBM, primarily because of poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Here, we report that ADC homogeneity and payload loading rate are critical parameters contributing to this discrepancy. Although both homogeneous and heterogeneous conjugates exhibit comparable in\\xa0vitro potency and pharmacokinetic profiles, the former shows enhanced payload delivery to brain tumors. Our homogeneous ADCs provide improved antitumor effects and survival benefits in orthotopic brain tumor models. We also demonstrate that overly drug-loaded species in heterogeneous conjugates are particularly poor at crossing the BBB, leading to deteriorated overall brain tumor targeting. Our findings indicate the importance of homogeneous conjugation with optimal payload loading in generating effective ADCs for intractable brain tumors.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Toward this prospect, we leverage mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to molecularly profile precursor and neuronal compartments of both human-derived organoids and mid-gestation fetal brain tissue to define overlapping programs. Our analysis includes recovery of precursor-enriched transcriptional regulatory proteins not found to be differentially expressed in previous transcriptomic datasets. To highlight the discovery potential of this resource, we show that RUVBL2 is preferentially expressed in the SOX2-positive compartment of organoids and that chemical inactivation leads to precursor cell displacement and apoptosis. To explore clinicopathological correlates of this cytoarchitectural disruption, we interrogate clinical datasets and identify rare de novo genetic variants involving RUVBL2 in patients with neurodevelopmental impairments. Together, our findings demonstrate how cell-type-specific profiling of organoids can help nominate previously unappreciated genes in neurodevelopment and disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Here, we report a synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathway through which PCDH19 bridges neuronal activity with gene expression. In particular, we describe the NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent proteolytic cleavage of PCDH19, which leads to the generation of a PCDH19 C-terminal fragment (CTF) able to enter the nucleus. We demonstrate that PCDH19 CTF associates with chromatin and with the chromatin remodeler lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and regulates expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs). Our results are consistent with a model whereby PCDH19 favors maintenance of neuronal homeostasis via negative feedback regulation of IEG expression and provide a key to interpreting PCDH19-related hyperexcitability.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

We thus propose recontextualizing epileptogenesis as a process where reduction in cellular heterogeneity, in part, renders neural circuits less resilient to seizure. By comparing patch clamp recordings from human layer 5 (L5) cortical pyramidal neurons from epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tissue, we demonstrate significantly decreased biophysical heterogeneity in seizure-generating areas. Implemented computationally, this renders model neural circuits prone to sudden transitions into synchronous states with increased firing activity, paralleling ictogenesis. This computational work also explains the surprising finding of significantly decreased excitability in the population-activation functions of neurons from epileptogenic tissue. Finally, mathematical analyses reveal a bifurcation structure arising only with low heterogeneity and associated with seizure-like dynamics. Taken together, this work provides experimental, computational, and mathematical support for the theory that ictogenic dynamics accompany a reduction in biophysical heterogeneity.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

A previous study showed that activation of GABA neurons in the postero-dorsal MeA (MeApd) with channelrhodopsin-2<sup>H134R</sup> (ChR2) stimulates inter-male aggression. When performing these experiments using the faster channelrhodopsin<sup>H134R,E123T</sup> (ChETA), we find the opposite behavioral outcome. A systematic comparison between the two channelrhodopsin variants reveals that optogenetic activation of MeApd GABA neurons with ChETA suppresses aggression, whereas activation under ChR2 increases aggression. Although the mechanism for this paradoxical difference is not understood, we observe that activation of MeApd GABA neurons with ChR2 causes larger plateau depolarizations, smaller action potentials, and larger local inhibition than with ChETA. Thus, the channelrhodopsin variant used for in\\xa0vivo optogenetic experiments can radically influence the behavioral outcome. Future work should continue to study the role of specific sub-populations of MeApd GABA neurons in aggression control.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Spectral changes in the hydrophone sensor signal are currently used to distinguish stable cavitation from inertial cavitation that can damage the<i>BBB</i>. Gibbs\\' ringing, peak intensity loss and peak width increase are well-known distortions evident when using the discrete Fourier transform (<i>DFT</i>) to transform data containing a few hundred points. We investigate overcoming the fact that<i>FUS</i>time signals (10 ms providing 312,500 points sampled at 32 ns intervals) can generate such sharp spectral peaks that variations in their<i>DFT</i>-related distortions can significantly impact the values of the key metrics used for cavitation characterization.<b>Approach:</b>We introduce low-pass filter hardware to improve how the analogue to digital convertor handles high-frequency noise components and the orders of magnitude differences between<i>FUS</i>harmonic intensities. We investigate the enhanced<i>FUS</i>spectral stability and resolution obtained from a new technique, physical sparsification (<i>PH-SP</i>), customized to the<i>a-priori</i>information that all key<i>FUS</i>components are harmonically related. Results are compared with standard DFT optimizations involving time data windowing and Fourier interpolation.<b>Main results:</b>A new simulation model showed peak intensity, widths and metrics modified by small changes in the transformed signal\\'s length when removing the noisy starting transient of the<i>FUS</i>hydrophone signal or following minor excitation frequency or sampling rate adjustments. 25% to 60% area-under-the-curve (<i>AUC</i>) changes occurred in phantom studies across different pressure levels Spectral peak sharpness was best optimized and stabilized with<i>PH-SP</i>.<b>Significance:</b>Special<i>FUS</i>characteristics mean starting transients and minor variations in experimental procedures lead to significant changes in the spectral metrics used to monitor cavitation levels. Customizing<i>PH-SP</i>to these characteristics led to sharper, more stable spectra with the potential to track the impact of microbubble environment changes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Creative Commons Attribution license.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN=\"Y\"><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Smith</LastName><ForeName>Michael R</ForeName><Initials>MR</Initials><Identifier Source=\"ORCID\">0000-0003-2363-632X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Electrical and Software Engineering, University of Calgary, ICT 402, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 1N4, CANADA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Khan</LastName><ForeName>Sonia</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Electrical and Software Engineering, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 1N4, CANADA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Curiel</LastName><ForeName>Laura</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><Identifier Source=\"ORCID\">0000-0001-8015-2626</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Electrical and Software Engineering, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 1N4, CANADA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI=\"D016428\">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType=\"Electronic\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>05</Month><Day>25</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Phys Med Biol</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0401220</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0031-9155</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner=\"NOTNLM\"><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">Blood-brain barrier (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;BBB&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">Focused ultrasound (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;FUS&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">Gibbs’ artefact suppression</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">Physical sparsification (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;PH-SP&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">Spectral resolution enhancement</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">Therapeutic drug passage</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus=\"entrez\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>25</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>32</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus=\"pubmed\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus=\"medline\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType=\"pubmed\">35613564</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType=\"doi\">10.1088/1361-6560/ac7374</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle><PubmedArticle><MedlineCitation Status=\"Publisher\" Owner=\"NLM\"><PMID Version=\"1\">35613559</PMID><DateRevised><Year>2022</Year><Month>05</Month><Day>25</Day></DateRevised><Article PubModel=\"Print-Electronic\"><Journal><ISSN IssnType=\"Electronic\">1361-6560</ISSN><JournalIssue CitedMedium=\"Internet\"><PubDate><Year>2022</Year><Month>May</Month><Day>25</Day></PubDate></JournalIssue><Title>Physics in medicine and biology</Title><ISOAbbreviation>Phys Med Biol</ISOAbbreviation></Journal><ArticleTitle>TransDose: a transformer-based UNet model for fast and accurate dose calculation for MR-LINACs.</ArticleTitle><ELocationID EIdType=\"doi\" ValidYN=\"Y\">10.1088/1361-6560/ac7376</ELocationID><Abstract><AbstractText Label=\"OBJECTIVE\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">To present a transformer-based UNet model (TransDose) for fast and accurate dose calculation for magnetic resonance-linear accelerators (MR-LINACs).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"APPROACH\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">A 2D fluence map from each beam was first projected into a 3D fluence volume and then fed into the TransDose model together with patient density volume and output predicted beam dose. The proposed TransDose model combined a 3D residual UNet with a transformer encoder, where convolutional layers extracted the volumetric spatial features, and the transformer encoder processed the long-range dependencies in a global space. Ninety-eight cases with four tumor sites (brain, nasopharynx, lung, and rectum) treated with fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy were included in the dataset; 78 cases were used for model training and validation; and 20 cases were used for testing. The ground-truth beam doses were calculated with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations within 1% statistical uncertainty and magnetic field strength B = 1.5 T in the superior and inferior direction. Beam angles from the training and validation datasets were rotated 2-5 times, and doses were recalculated to augment the datasets.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">The dose-volume histograms and indices between the predicted and MC doses showed good consistency. The average 3D γ-passing rates (3%/2 mm, for dose regions above 10% of maximum dose) were 99.13±0.89% (brain), 98.31±1.92% (nasopharynx), 98.74±0.70% (lung), and 99.28±0.25% (rectum). The average dose calculation time, which included the fluence projection and model prediction, was less than 310 ms for each beam.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"SIGNIFICANCE\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">We successfully developed a transformer-based UNet dose calculation model-TransDose in magnetic fields. Its accuracy and efficiency indicated its potential for use in online adaptive plan optimization for MR-LINACs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>© 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN=\"Y\"><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Xiao</LastName><ForeName>Fan</ForeName><Initials>F</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, South Shatai Road No.1023, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, China, Guangzhou, 510515, CHINA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Cai</LastName><ForeName>Jiajun</ForeName><Initials>J</Initials><Identifier Source=\"ORCID\">0000-0002-4024-8380</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, South Shatai Road No.1023, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, China, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, CHINA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Zhou</LastName><ForeName>Xuanru</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Southern Medical University, School of Biomedical Engineering Guangzhou, Guangdong, CN, South Shatai Road No.1023, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, China, Guanzhou, 510515, CHINA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Zhou</LastName><ForeName>Linghong</ForeName><Initials>L</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, South Shatai Road No.1023, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, China, Guangzhou, 510515, CHINA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Song</LastName><ForeName>Ting</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, South Shatai Road No.1023, Baiyun District, Guangzhou, China, Guangzhou, 510515, CHINA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=\"Y\"><LastName>Li</LastName><ForeName>Yongbao</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><Identifier Source=\"ORCID\">0000-0002-6741-5281</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, East Dongfeng Road No.651, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, China, Guangzhou, 510060, CHINA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI=\"D016428\">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType=\"Electronic\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>05</Month><Day>25</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>England</Country><MedlineTA>Phys Med Biol</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0401220</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0031-9155</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner=\"NOTNLM\"><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">MR-LINAC</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">adaptive radiotherapy</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">dose calculation</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN=\"N\">transformer</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus=\"entrez\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>25</Day><Hour>18</Hour><Minute>32</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus=\"pubmed\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus=\"medline\"><Year>2022</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType=\"pubmed\">35613559</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType=\"doi\">10.1088/1361-6560/ac7376</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>'"

Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Tissue and organ function has been conventionally understood in terms of the interactions among discrete and homogeneous cell types. This approach has proven difficult in neuroscience due to the marked diversity across different neuron classes, but it may be further hampered by prominent within-class variability. Here, we considered a well-defined canonical neuronal population—hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1 PCs)—and systematically examined the extent and spatial rules of transcriptional heterogeneity. Using next-generation RNA sequencing, we identified striking variability in CA1 PCs, such that the differences within CA1 along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous gene-expression gradients, producing a transcriptional profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells. This work reveals an unexpected amount of variability within a canonical and narrowly defined neuronal population and suggests that continuous, within-class heterogeneity may be an important feature of neural circuits.',\n",

Here, we used next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a quantitative, whole genome characterization of gene expression for the major excitatory neuronal classes of the hippocampus; namely, granule cells and mossy cells of the dentate gyrus, and pyramidal cells of areas CA3, CA2, and CA1. Moreover, for the canonical cell classes of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell-class- and region-specific transcriptional description for these populations. This dataset clarifies the transcriptional properties and identities of lesser-known cell classes, and moreover reveals unexpected variation in the trisynaptic loop across the dorsal-ventral axis. We have created a public resource, Hipposeq (http://hipposeq.janelia.org), which provides analysis and visualization of these data and will act as a roadmap relating molecules to cells, circuits, and computation in the hippocampus.

In the cerebral cortex, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed the genome-wide expression patterns that define its many, closely related neuronal types, but cannot reveal their spatial arrangement. Here we introduce probabilistic cell typing by in situ sequencing (pciSeq), an approach that leverages previous scRNA-seq classification to identify cell types using multiplexed in situ RNA detection. We applied this method by mapping the inhibitory neurons of mouse hippocampal area CA1, for which ground truth is available from extensive previous work identifying their laminar organization. Our method identified these neuronal classes in a spatial arrangement matching ground truth, and further identified multiple classes of isocortical pyramidal cell in a pattern matching their known organization. This method will allow identifying the spatial organization of closely related cell types across the brain and other tissues.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Complementary actions of the neocortex and the hippocampus enable encoding and long-term storage of experience dependent memories. Standard models for memory storage assume that sensory signals reach the hippocampus from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Deep layers of the EC on the other hand relay hippocampal outputs to the telencephalic structures including many parts of the neocortex. Here, we show that cells in layer 5a of the medial EC send a copy of their telencephalic outputs back to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Combining cell-type-specific anatomical tracing with high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that in the mouse brain these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our results suggest that projections of deep medial EC neurons are anatomically configured to influence the hippocampus and neocortex simultaneously and therefore lead to novel hypotheses on the functional role of the deep EC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The rs17070145-T variant of the WWC1 gene, coding for the KIBRA protein, has been associated with both increased episodic memory performance and lowered risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease, although the mechanism behind this protective effect has not been completely elucidated. To achieve a better understanding of the pathways modulated by rs17070145 and its associated functional variant(s), we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-sequencing to investigate the effect of rs17070145 genotypes on whole transcriptome expression in the human hippocampus (HP) of 22 neuropathologically normal individuals, with a specific focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) and at the pyramidal cells (PC) of CA1 and CA3 sub-regions. Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data within the HP based on the rs17070145 genotype revealed an overexpression of genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, potentially driven by the T/T genotype. The most important contribution comes from genes dysregulated within the DG region. Other genes significantly dysregulated, and not involved in the MAPK pathway (Adj P\\u2009<\\u20090.01 and Fold Change\\u2009>\\u2009|1.00|) were: RSPO4 (HP); ARC, DUSP5, DNAJB5, EGR4, PPP1R15A, WBP11P1, EGR1, GADD45B (DG); CH25H, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, TNFSF9, and NPAS4 (PC). Several evidences suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway is linked with memory and learning processes. In non-neuronal cells, the KIBRA protein is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (involved in the MAPK signaling) in cells as well as in vitro. Several of the other dysregulated genes are involved in memory and learning processes, as well as in Alzheimer's Disease. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of the WWC1 rs17070145 polymorphism on memory performance and Alzheimer's disease might be due to a differential regulation of the MAPK signaling, a key pathway involved in memory and learning processes.\",\n",

This process relies in part on transcription, but neither the rate of activity nor baseline transcription is equal across neuronal cell types. In this study, we isolated mouse hippocampal populations with different activity levels and used single nucleus RNA-seq to compare their transcriptional responses to activation. One hour after novel environment exposure, sparsely active dentate granule (DG) neurons had a much stronger transcriptional response compared to more highly active CA1 pyramidal cells and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons. Activity continued to impact transcription in DG neurons up to 5\\u2009h, with increased heterogeneity. By re-exposing the mice to the same environment, we identified a unique transcriptional signature that selects DG neurons for reactivation upon re-exposure to the same environment. These results link transcriptional heterogeneity to functional heterogeneity and identify a transcriptional correlate of memory encoding in individual DG neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Exposure to specific doses of hypoxia can trigger endogenous neuroprotective and neuroplastic mechanisms of the central nervous system. These molecular mechanisms, together referred to as hypoxic preconditioning (HPC), remain poorly understood. In the present study, we applied RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses to study HPC in a whole-body HPC mouse model. The preconditioned (H4) and control (H0) groups showed 605 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 263 were upregulated and 342 were downregulated. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that these DEGs were enriched in several biological processes, including metabolic stress and angiogenesis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis showed that the FOXO and Notch signaling pathways were involved in hypoxic tolerance and protection during HPC. Furthermore, 117 differential alternative splicing events (DASEs) were identified, with exon skipping being the dominant one (48.51%). Repeated exposure to systemic hypoxia promoted skipping of exon 7 in Edrf1 and exon 9 or 13 in Lrrc45. This study expands the understanding of the endogenous protective mechanisms of HPC and the DASEs that occur during HPC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The subcellular localization and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) supports functional differentiation between cellular compartments. In neuronal dendrites, local translation of mRNA provides a rapid and specific mechanism for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain brain disorders. Despite the importance of dendritic mRNA translation, little is known about which mRNAs can be translated in dendrites in vivo and when their translation occurs. Here we collect ribosome-bound mRNA from the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus. We find that dendritic mRNA rapidly associates with ribosomes following a novel experience consisting of a contextual fear conditioning trial. High throughput RNA sequencing followed by machine learning classification reveals an unexpected breadth of ribosome-bound dendritic mRNAs, including mRNAs expected to be entirely somatic. Our findings are in agreement with a mechanism of synaptic plasticity that engages the acute local translation of functionally diverse dendritic mRNAs. ',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Although circadian rhythms are thought to be essential for maintaining body health, the effects of chronic circadian disruption during neurodevelopment remain elusive. Here, using the \"Short Day\" (SD) mouse model, in which an 8 h/8 h light/dark (LD) cycle was applied from embryonic day 1 to postnatal day 42, we investigated the molecular and behavioral changes after circadian disruption in mice. Adult SD mice fully entrained to the 8 h/8 h LD cycle, and the circadian oscillations of the clock proteins, PERIOD1 and PERIOD2, were disrupted in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the hippocampus of these mice. By RNA-seq widespread changes were identified in the hippocampal transcriptome, which are functionally associated with neurodevelopment, translational control, and autism. By western blotting and immunostaining hyperactivation of the mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways and enhanced global protein synthesis were found in the hippocampi of SD mice. Electrophysiological recording uncovered enhanced excitatory, but attenuated inhibitory, synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These functional changes at synapses were corroborated by the immature morphology of the dendritic spines in these neurons. Lastly, autistic-like animal behavioral changes, including impaired social interaction and communication, increased repetitive behaviors, and impaired novel object recognition and location memory, were found in SD mice. Together, these results demonstrate molecular, cellular, and behavioral changes in SD mice, all of which resemble autistic-like phenotypes caused by circadian rhythm disruption. The findings highlight a critical role for circadian rhythms in neurodevelopment.',\n",

In the adult brain, CDH13 expression is restricted e.g. to the presynaptic compartment of inhibitory GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus and Cdh13 knockout mice show an increased inhibitory drive onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, leading to a shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance. CDH13 is also moderating migration of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, establishing projections preferentially to the thalamus and cerebellum during brain development. Furthermore, CDH13 is upregulated by chronic stress as well as in depression, suggesting a role in early-life adaptation to stressful experience.

       "  'Abstract': 'Genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (such as stress) can interact to affect the likelihood of developing a mood disorder. Stress-induced changes in the hippocampus have been implicated in mood disorders, and mutations in several genes have now been associated with increased risk, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The hippocampus has important anatomical subdivisions, and pyramidal neurons of the vulnerable CA3 region show significant remodeling after chronic stress, but the mechanisms underlying their unique plasticity remain unknown. This study characterizes stress-induced changes in the in vivo translating mRNA of this cell population using a CA3-specific enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter fused to the L10a large ribosomal subunit (EGFPL10a). RNA-sequencing after isolation of polysome-bound mRNAs allows for cell-type-specific, genome-wide characterization of translational changes after stress. The data demonstrate that acute and chronic stress produce unique translational profiles and that the stress history of the animal can alter future reactivity of CA3 neurons. CA3-specific EGFPL10a mice were then crossed to the stress-susceptible BDNF Val66Met mouse line to characterize how a known genetic susceptibility alters both baseline translational profiles and the reactivity of CA3 neurons to stress. Not only do Met allele carriers exhibit distinct levels of baseline translation in genes implicated in ion channel function and cytoskeletal regulation, but they also activate a stress response profile that is highly dissimilar from wild-type mice. Closer examination of genes implicated in the mechanisms of neuroplasticity, such as the NMDA and AMPA subunits and the BDNF pathway, reveal how wild-type mice upregulate many of these genes in response to stress, but Met allele carriers fail to do so. These profiles provide a roadmap of stress-induced changes in a genetically homogenous population of hippocampal neurons and illustrate the profound effects of gene-environment interactions on the translational profile of these cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Despite widespread interest in using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in neurological disease modeling, a suitable model system to study human neuronal connectivity is lacking. Here, we report a comprehensive and efficient differentiation paradigm for hiPSCs that generate multiple CA3 pyramidal neuron subtypes as detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This differentiation paradigm exhibits characteristics of neuronal network maturation, and rabies virus tracing revealed synaptic connections between stem cell-derived dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 neurons in\\xa0vitro recapitulating the neuronal connectivity within the hippocampus. Because hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in schizophrenia, we applied DG and CA3 differentiation paradigms to schizophrenia-patient-derived hiPSCs. We detected reduced activity in DG-CA3 co-culture and deficits in spontaneous and evoked activity in CA3 neurons from schizophrenia-patient-derived hiPSCs. Our approach offers critical insights into the network activity aspects of schizophrenia and may serve as a promising tool for modeling diseases with hippocampal vulnerability. VIDEO ABSTRACT.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates expression of a diverse set of genes. However, NRSF function in brain development still remains elusive. In the present study, we generated NRSF-conditional knockout (NRSF-cKO) mice by hGFAP-Cre/loxp system to study the effect of NRSF deficiency on brain development. Results showed that NRSF conditional knockout caused a smaller hippocampus and a thinner granule cell layer (GCL) in mice. Moreover, the reduction and disarrangement of GFAP+ cells in subgranular zone (SGZ) of NRSF-cKO mice was accompanied with the decreased number of premature neurons, neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as well as compromising the majority of mitotically active cells. The analysis of postnatal development of hippocampus indicated the existence of an abnormality at postnatal day (P) 8, rather than at P1, in NRSF-cKO mice, although the densities of Ki67+ cells with mitotic ability in dentate gyrus were relatively unaffected at P1 and P8. Meanwhile, NRSF deficiency led to abnormal organization of SGZ at P8 during postnatal development. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 79 deregulated genes in hippocampus of NRSF-cKO mice at P8, which were involved in p53 signal transduction, neuron migration and negative regulation of cell proliferation, etc. The deregulation of p53 pathway in NRSF-cKO mice at P1 and P8 was evidenced, of which p21/Cdkn1a was accumulated in a portion of NSCs and NPCs in hippocampus during postnatal development. Together, these results, for the first time, revealed that NRSF could significantly influence the postnatal development of hippocampus, especially the formation of SGZ.',\n",

Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the molecular dynamics and diversity of dentate gyrus cell types in perinatal, juvenile, and adult mice. We found distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. We observed shifts in the molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia and granule cells during the postnatal period that were then maintained through adult stages. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These findings demonstrate the fundamental similarity of postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem cells.',\n",

Of the ~9 million expression quantitative trait loci identified in the DG-GCL, 15% were not detected in bulk hippocampus, including 15 schizophrenia risk variants. We created transcriptome-wide association study genetic weights from the DG-GCL, which identified many schizophrenia-associated genetic signals not found in transcriptome-wide association studies from bulk hippocampus, including GRM3 and CACNA1C.

We investigated the transcriptome of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in postmortem human hippocampus in 79 subjects with mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression) and nonpsychiatric controls. We show that the choice of normalization approach for analysis of RNA-seq data had a strong effect on results; under our experimental conditions a nonstandard normalization method gave superior results. We found evidence of disrupted signaling by miR-182 in mental illness. This was confirmed using a novel method of leveraging microRNA genetic variant information to indicate active targeting. In healthy subjects and those with bipolar disorder, carriers of a high- vs those with a low-expressing genotype of miR-182 had different levels of miR-182 target gene expression, indicating an active role of miR-182 in shaping the DG transcriptome for those subject groups. By contrast, comparing the transcriptome between carriers of different genotypes among subjects with major depression and schizophrenia suggested a loss of DG miR-182 signaling in these conditions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in two distinct niches in the mammalian brain, the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the forebrain lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. They are thought to be molecularly distinct since V-SVZ NSCs produce inhibitory olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons and SGZ NSCs excitatory dentate granule neurons. Here, we have asked whether this is so by directly comparing V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs from embryogenesis to adulthood using single-cell transcriptional data. We show that the embryonic radial glial precursor (RP) parents of these two NSC populations are very similar, but differentially express a small cohort of genes involved in glutamatergic versus GABAergic neurogenesis. These different RPs then undergo a similar gradual transition to a dormant adult NSC state over the first three postnatal weeks. This dormancy state involves transcriptional shutdown of genes that maintain an active, proliferative, prodifferentiation state and induction of genes involved in sensing and regulating their niche environment. Moreover, when reactivated to generate adult-born progeny, both populations reacquire a development-like state and re-express proneurogenic genes. Thus, V-SVZ and SGZ NSCs share a common transcriptional state throughout their lifespans and transition into and out of dormancy via similar trajectories.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Animals can store information about experiences by activating specific neuronal populations, and subsequent reactivation of these neural ensembles can lead to recall of salient experiences. In the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus participate in such memory engrams; however, whether there is an underlying logic to granule cell participation has not been examined. Here, we find that a range of novel experiences preferentially activates granule cells of the suprapyramidal blade relative to the infrapyramidal blade. Motivated by this, we identify a suprapyramidal-blade-enriched population of granule cells with distinct spatial, morphological, physiological, and developmental properties. Via transcriptomics, we map these traits onto a sparse and discrete granule cell subtype that is recruited at a 10-fold greater frequency than expected by subtype prevalence, constituting the majority of all recruited granule cells. Thus, in behaviors known to involve hippocampal-dependent memory formation, a rare and spatially localized subtype dominates overall granule cell recruitment.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the adult brain, new dentate granule cells integrate into neural circuits and participate in hippocampal functioning. However, when and how they initiate\\xa0this integration remain poorly understood. Using\\xa0retroviral and live-imaging methods, we find that new neurons undergo neurite remodeling for competitive horizontal-to-radial repositioning in the dentate gyrus prior to circuit integration. Gene expression profiling, lipidomics analysis, and molecular interrogation of new neurons during this period reveal a rapid activation of sphingolipid signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1.\\xa0Genetic manipulation of this G protein-coupled receptor reveals its requirement for successful repositioning of new neurons. This receptor is also activated by hippocampus-engaged behaviors, which enhances repositioning efficiency. These findings reveal that activity-dependent sphingolipid signaling regulates cellular repositioning of new dentate granule cells. The competitive horizontal-to-radial repositioning of new neurons may provide a gating strategy in the adult brain to limit the integration of new neurons into pre-existing circuits.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Despite representing only a small fraction of hippocampal granule cells, adult-generated newborn granule cells have been implicated in learning and memory (Aimone et al., 2011). Newborn granule cells undergo functional maturation and circuit integration over a period of weeks. However, it is difficult to assess the accompanying gene expression profiles in vivo with high spatial and temporal resolution using traditional methods. Here we used a novel method [\"thiouracil (TU) tagging\"] to map the profiles of nascent mRNAs in mouse immature newborn granule cells compared with mature granule cells. We targeted a nonmammalian uracil salvage enzyme, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, to newborn neurons and mature granule cells using retroviral and lentiviral constructs, respectively. Subsequent injection of 4-TU tagged nascent RNAs for analysis by RNA sequencing. Several hundred genes were significantly enhanced in the retroviral dataset compared with the lentiviral dataset. We compared a selection of the enriched genes with steady-state levels of mRNAs using quantitative PCR. Ontology analysis revealed distinct patterns of nascent mRNA expression, with newly generated immature neurons showing enhanced expression for genes involved in synaptic function, and neural differentiation and development, as well as genes not previously associated with granule cell maturation. Surprisingly, the nascent mRNAs enriched in mature cells were related to energy homeostasis and metabolism, presumably indicative of the increased energy demands of synaptic transmission and their complex dendritic architecture. The high spatial and temporal resolution of our modified TU-tagging method provides a foundation for comparison with steady-state RNA analyses by traditional transcriptomic approaches in defining the functional roles of newborn neurons.

       "  'Abstract': 'Single-cell sequencing methods have emerged as powerful tools for identification of heterogeneous cell types within defined brain regions. Application of single-cell techniques to study the transcriptome of activated neurons can offer insight into molecular dynamics associated with differential neuronal responses to a given experience. Through evaluation of common whole-cell and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) methods, here we show that snRNA-seq faithfully recapitulates transcriptional patterns associated with experience-driven induction of activity, including immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Fos, Arc and Egr1. SnRNA-seq of mouse dentate granule cells reveals large-scale changes in the activated neuronal transcriptome after brief novel environment exposure, including induction of MAPK pathway genes. In addition, we observe a continuum of activation states, revealing a pseudotemporal pattern of activation from gene expression alone. In summary, snRNA-seq of activated neurons enables the examination of gene expression beyond IEGs, allowing for novel insights into neuronal activation patterns in vivo.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Transient Receptor Potential Canonical 6 (TRPC6) has been suggested to be involved in synapse function and contribute to hippocampal-dependent cognitive processes. Gene silencing of TRPC6 was performed by injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing TRPC6-specific shRNA (shRNA-TRPC6) into the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Spatial learning, working memory and social recognition memory were impaired in the shRNA-TRPC6 treated mice compared to control mice after 4 weeks. In addition, gene ontology (GO) analysis of RNA-sequencing revealed that viral intervention of TRPC6 expression in DG resulted in the enrichment of the process of synaptic transmission and cellular compartment of synaptic structure. KEGG analysis showed PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, the shRNA-TRPC6 treatment reduced dendritic spines of DG granule neurons, in terms of spine loss, the thin and mushroom types predominated. Accompanying the spine loss, the levels of PSD95, pAkt and CREB in the hippocampus were decreased in the shRNA-TRPC6 treated animals. Taken together, our results suggest that knocking down TRPC6 in the DG have a disadvantageous effect on cognitive processes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Enzymes that regulate histone lysine methylation play important roles in neuronal differentiation, but little is known about their contributions to activity-regulated gene transcription in differentiated neurons. We characterized activity-regulated expression of lysine demethylases and lysine methyltransferases in the hippocampus of adult male mice following pilocarpine-induced seizure. Pilocarpine drove a 20-fold increase in mRNA encoding the histone H3 lysine 27-specific demethylase Kdm6b selectively in granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, and this induction was recapitulated in cultured hippocampal neurons by bicuculline and 4-aminopyridine (Bic + 4AP) stimulation of synaptic activity. Because activity-regulated gene expression is highly correlated with neuronal survival, we tested the requirement for Kdm6b expression in Bic + 4AP induced preconditioning of neuronal survival. Prior exposure to Bic + 4AP promoted neuronal survival in control neurons upon growth factor withdrawal; however, this effect was ablated when we knocked down Kdm6b expression. Loss of Kdm6b did not disrupt activity-induced expression of most genes, including that of a gene set previously established to promote neuronal survival in this assay. However, using bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequencing data, we discovered that Kdm6b knockdown neurons showed impaired inducibility of a discrete set of genes annotated for their function in inflammation. These data reveal a novel function for Kdm6b in activity-regulated neuronal survival, and they suggest that activity- and Kdm6b-dependent regulation of inflammatory gene pathways may serve as an adaptive pro-survival response to increased neuronal activity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Circuit formation in the central nervous system has been historically studied during development, after which cell-autonomous and nonautonomous wiring factors inactivate. In principle, balanced reactivation of such factors could enable further wiring in adults, but their relative contributions may be circuit dependent and are largely unknown. Here, we investigated hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting to gain insight into wiring mechanisms in mature circuits. We found that sole ectopic expression of Id2 in granule cells is capable of driving mossy fiber sprouting in healthy adult mouse and rat. Mice with the new mossy fiber circuit solved spatial problems equally well as controls but appeared to rely on local rather than global spatial cues. Our results demonstrate reprogrammed connectivity in mature neurons by one defined factor and an assembly of a new synaptic circuit in adult brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, a major component of the medial temporal lobe memory circuit, are selectively vulnerable during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cellular mechanism(s) underlying degeneration of these neurons and the relationship to cognitive performance remains largely undefined. Here, we profiled neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor gene expression within microdissected CA1 neurons along with regional hippocampal dissections from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD using laser capture microdissection (LCM), custom-designed microarray analysis, and qPCR of CA1 subregional dissections. Gene expression levels were correlated with cognitive test scores and AD neuropathology criteria. We found a significant downregulation of several neurotrophin genes (e.g., Gdnf, Ngfb, and Ntf4) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in MCI compared to NCI and AD subjects. In addition, the neurotrophin receptor transcripts TrkB and TrkC were decreased in MCI and AD compared to NCI. Regional hippocampal dissections also revealed select neurotrophic gene dysfunction providing evidence for vulnerability within the hippocampus proper during the progression of dementia. Downregulation of several neurotrophins of the NGF family and cognate neurotrophin receptor (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) genes correlated with antemortem cognitive measures including the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), a composite global cognitive score (GCS), and Episodic, Semantic, and Working Memory, Perceptual Speed, and Visuospatial domains. Significant correlations were found between select neurotrophic expression downregulation and neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), but not diffuse plaques (DPs). These data suggest that dysfunction of neurotrophin signaling complexes have profound negative sequelae within vulnerable hippocampal cell types, which play a role in mnemonic and executive dysfunction during the progression of AD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Molecular mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis in the developing brain remain poorly understood. The gene array approach could reveal some of the factors involved by allowing the identification of a broad scale of genes altered by seizures. In this study we used microarray analysis to reveal the gene expression profile of the laser microdissected hippocampal CA1 subregion one week after kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) in 21-day-old rats, which are developmentally roughly comparable to juvenile children. The gene expression analysis with the Chipster software generated a total of 1592 differently expressed genes in the CA1 subregion of KA-treated rats compared to control rats. The KEGG database revealed that the identified genes were involved in pathways such as oxidative phosporylation (26 genes changed), and long-term potentiation (LTP; 18 genes changed). Also genes involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis, gliosis, inflammation, and GABAergic transmission were altered. To validate the microarray results we further examined the protein expression for a subset of selected genes, glial fibrillary protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein E (apo E), cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1), Purkinje cell protein 4 (PEP-19), and interleukin 8 receptor (CXCR1), with immunohistochemistry, which confirmed the transcriptome results. Our results showed that SE resulted in no obvious CA1 neuronal loss, and alterations in the expression pattern of several genes during the early epileptogenic phase were comparable to previous gene expression studies of the adult hippocampus of both experimental epileptic animals and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, some changes seem to occur after SE specifically in the juvenile rat hippocampus. Insight of the SE-induced alterations in gene expression and their related pathways could give us hints for the development of new target-specific antiepileptic drugs that interfere with the progression of the disease in the juvenile age group.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hTau mouse model of tauopathy was utilized to assess gene expression changes in vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons. CA1 pyramidal neurons were microaspirated via laser capture microdissection followed by RNA amplification in combination with custom-designed microarray analysis and qPCR validation in hTau mice and nontransgenic (ntg) littermates aged 11-14months. Statistical analysis revealed ~8% of all the genes on the array platform were dysregulated, with notable downregulation of several synaptic-related markers including synaptophysin (Syp), synaptojanin, and synaptobrevin, among others. Downregulation was also observed for select glutamate receptors (GluRs), Psd-95, TrkB, and several protein phosphatase subunits. In contrast, upregulation of tau isoforms and a calpain subunit were found. Microarray assessment of synaptic-related markers in a separate cohort of hTau mice at 7-8months of age indicated only a few alterations compared to the 11-14month cohort, suggesting progressive synaptic dysfunction occurs as tau accumulates in CA1 pyramidal neurons. An assessment of SYP and PSD-95 expression was performed in the hippocampal CA1 sector of hTau and ntg mice via confocal laser scanning microscopy along with hippocampal immunoblot analysis for protein-based validation of selected microarray observations. Results indicate significant decreases in SYP-immunoreactive and PSD-95-immunoreactive puncta as well as downregulation of SYP-immunoreactive and PSD-95-immunoreactive band intensity in hTau mice compared to age-matched ntg littermates. In summary, the high prevalence of downregulation of synaptic-related genes indicates that the moderately aged hTau mouse may be a model of tau-induced synaptodegeneration, and has profound effects on how we perceive progressive tau pathology affecting synaptic transmission in AD.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Although there are changes in gene expression and alterations in neuronal density and afferent inputs in the forebrain of trisomic mouse models of Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a lack of systematic assessments of gene expression and encoded proteins within individual vulnerable cell populations, precluding translational investigations at the molecular and cellular level. Further, no effective treatment exists to combat intellectual disability and basal forebrain cholinergic neurodegeneration seen in DS. To further our understanding of gene expression changes before and following cholinergic degeneration in a well-established mouse model of DS/AD, the Ts65Dn mouse, we assessed RNA expression levels from CA1 pyramidal neurons at two adult ages (∼6 months of age and ∼11 months of age) in both Ts65Dn and their normal disomic (2N) littermates. We further examined a therapeutic intervention, maternal choline supplementation (MCS), which has been previously shown to lessen dysfunction in spatial cognition and attention, and have protective effects on the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the Ts65Dn mouse model. Results indicate that MCS normalized expression of several genes in key gene ontology categories, including synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling, and AD-associated neurodegeneration related to amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) clearance. Specifically, normalized expression levels were found for endothelin converting enzyme-2 (Ece2), insulin degrading enzyme (Ide), Dyrk1a, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Camk2a), among other relevant genes. Single population expression profiling of vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons indicates that MCS is a viable therapeutic for long-term reprogramming of key transcripts involved in neuronal signaling that are dysregulated in the trisomic mouse brain which have translational potential for DS and AD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"To evaluate molecular signatures of an individual cell type in comparison to the associated region relevant towards understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CA1 pyramidal neurons and the surrounding hippocampal formation were microaspirated via laser capture microdissection (LCM) from neuropathologically confirmed AD and age-matched control (CTR) subjects as well as from wild type mouse brain using single population RNA amplification methodology coupled with custom-designed microarray analysis with real-time quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (qPCR) validation. CA1 pyramidal neurons predominantly displayed downregulation of classes of transcripts related to synaptic transmission in AD versus CTR. Regional hippocampal dissections displayed downregulation of several overlapping genes found in the CA1 neuronal population related to neuronal expression, as well as upregulation of select transcripts indicative of admixed cell types including glial-associated markers and immediate-early and cell death genes. Gene level distributions observed in CA1 neurons and regional hippocampal dissections in wild type mice paralleled expression mosaics seen in postmortem human tissue. Microarray analysis was validated in qPCR studies using human postmortem brain tissue and CA1 sector and regional hippocampal dissections obtained from a mouse model of AD/Down syndrome (Ts65Dn mice) and normal disomic (2N) littermates. Classes of transcripts that have a greater percentage of the overall hybridization signal intensity within single neurons tended to be genes related to neuronal communication. The converse was also found, as classes of transcripts such as glial-associated markers were under represented in CA1 pyramidal neuron expression profiles relative to regional hippocampal dissections. These observations highlight a dilution effect that is likely to occur in conventional regional microarray and qPCR studies. Thus, single population studies of specific neurons and intrinsic circuits will likely yield informative gene expression profile data that may be subthreshold and/or underrepresented in regional studies with an admixture of cell types.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Down syndrome (DS) is the most prevalent cause of intellectual disability (ID). Individuals with DS show a variety of cognitive deficits, most notably in hippocampal learning and memory, and display pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with neurodegeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons. Elucidation of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of neuropathology has been assessed via gene expression analysis in a relevant animal model, termed the Ts65Dn mouse. The Ts65Dn mouse is a segmental trisomy model of DS that mimics DS/AD pathology, notably age-related cognitive dysfunction and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). To determine expression level changes, molecular fingerprinting of cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) pyramidal neurons was performed in adult (4-9 month-old) Ts65Dn mice, at the initiation of BFCN degeneration. To quantitate transcriptomic changes during this early time period, laser capture microdissection (LCM), terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification, custom-designed microarray analysis, and subsequent validation of individual transcripts by qPCR and protein analysis via immunoblotting was performed. The results indicate significant alterations within CA1 pyramidal neurons of Ts65Dn mice compared with normal disomic (2N) littermates, notably in the downregulation of neurotrophins and their cognate neurotrophin receptors among other classes of transcripts relevant to neurodegeneration. The results of this single-population gene expression analysis at the time of septohippocampal deficits in a trisomic mouse model shed light on a vulnerable circuit that may cause the AD-like pathology invariably seen in DS that could help to identify mechanisms of degeneration, and provide novel gene targets for therapeutic interventions.

       "  'Abstract': \"Clinical neuropathologic studies suggest that the selective vulnerability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal projection neurons plays a key role in the onset of cognitive impairment during the early phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disruption of this neuronal population likely affects hippocampal pre- and postsynaptic efficacy underlying episodic memory circuits. Therefore, identifying perturbations in the expression of synaptic gene products within CA1 neurons prior to frank AD is crucial for the development of disease modifying therapies. Here we used custom-designed microarrays to examine progressive alterations in synaptic gene expression within CA1 neurons in cases harvested from the Rush Religious Orders Study who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a putative prodromal AD stage), or mild/moderate AD. Quantitative analysis revealed that 21 out of 28 different transcripts encoding regulators of synaptic function were significantly downregulated (1.4-1.8 fold) in CA1 neurons in MCI and AD compared to NCI, whereas synaptic transcript levels were not significantly different between MCI and AD. The downregulated transcripts encoded regulators of presynaptic vesicle trafficking, including synaptophysin and synaptogyrin, regulators of vesicle docking and fusion/release, such as synaptotagmin and syntaxin 1, and regulators of glutamatergic postsynaptic function, including PSD-95 and synaptopodin. Clinical pathologic correlation analysis revealed that downregulation of these synaptic markers was strongly associated with poorer antemortem cognitive status and postmortem AD pathological criteria such as Braak stage, NIA-Reagan, and CERAD diagnosis. In contrast to the widespread loss of synaptic gene expression observed in CA1 neurons in MCI, transcripts encoding β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP family members, and regulators of APP metabolism were not differentially regulated in CA1 neurons across the clinical diagnostic groups. Taken together, these data suggest that CA1 synaptic gene dysregulation occurs early in the cascade of pathogenic molecular events prior to the onset of AD, which may form the basis for novel pharmacological treatment approaches for this dementing disorder.

       "  'Abstract': \"Down syndrome (DS) is caused by the triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) and is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, with individuals having deficits in cognitive function including hippocampal learning and memory and neurodegeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, the molecular underpinnings driving this pathology have not been elucidated. The Ts65Dn mouse is a segmental trisomy model of DS and like DS/AD pathology, displays age-related cognitive dysfunction and basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) degeneration. To determine molecular and cellular changes important for elucidating mechanisms of neurodegeneration in DS/AD pathology, expression profiling studies were performed. Molecular fingerprinting of homogeneous populations of Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) pyramidal neurons was performed via laser capture microdissection followed by Terminal Continuation RNA amplification combined with custom-designed microarray analysis and subsequent validation of individual transcripts by qPCR and protein analysis via immunoblotting. Significant alterations were observed within CA1 pyramidal neurons of aged Ts65Dn mice compared to normal disomic (2N) littermates, notably in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission receptor families and neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor as well as several cognate neurotrophin receptors. Examining gene and protein expression levels after the onset of BFCN degeneration elucidated transcriptional and translational changes in neurons within a vulnerable circuit that may cause the AD-like pathology seen in DS as these individuals age, and provide rational targets for therapeutic interventions. \",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have used laser-capture microdissection and microarray hybridization to characterize gene expression in the three principal neuron layers of rat hippocampus. Correlative and clustering analyses revealed all three layers to be easily differentiated from one another based on gene expression profile alone. A greater disparity in gene expression exists between dentate granule and pyramidal cell layers, reflecting phenotypic and ontological differences between those cell populations. Remarkably, the level of more than 45% of expressed transcripts was significantly different among the three neuron populations, with more than a third of those (>1,000 transcripts) being at least twofold different between layers. Even CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers were dramatically different on a transcriptional level with a separate analysis indicating that nearly 20% of transcripts are differentially expressed between them. Only a small number of transcripts were specific for a given hippocampal cell layer, suggesting that functional differences are more likely secondary to wide-ranging expression differences of modest magnitude rather than very large disparities in a few genes. Categorical analysis of transcript abundance revealed concerted differences in gene expression among the three cell layers referable to specific cellular pathways. For instance, transcripts encoding proteins involved in glucose metabolism are most highly expressed in the CA3 pyramidal layer, which may reflect an underlying greater metabolic rate of these neurons and partially explain their exquisite vulnerability to seizure-induced damage. Conversely, transcripts related to MAP kinase signaling pathways and transcriptional regulator activity are prominent in the dentate granule cell layer, which could contribute to its resistance to damage following seizure activity by positioning these neurons to respond to external stimuli by altering transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that unique physiological characteristics of major cell layers, such as neuronal activity, neuronal plasticity, and vulnerability to neurodegeneration, are reflected in substantial transcriptional heterogeneity within the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus contains several distinct cell types that are interconnected by a well-characterized series of synaptic circuits. To evaluate molecular and cellular signatures of individual cell types within the normal adult human hippocampal formation, expression profile analysis was performed on individual CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons using a novel single cell RNA amplification methodology coupled with custom-designed cDNA array analysis. Populations of CA1 and CA3 neurons were also compared with regional dissections of the hippocampus from the same tissue sections. Molecular fingerprint comparison of cresyl violet-stained CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons microaspirated from the hippocampus of normal control subjects indicated significant differences in relative expression levels for approximately 16% (20 of 125) genes evaluated on the custom-designed cDNA array platform. Significant differences were observed for several transcripts relevant to the structure and function of hippocampal neurons, including specific glutamate receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors, cytoskeletal elements, dopamine receptors, and immediate-early genes. Compared with the regional assessment of gene expression, both CA1 and CA3 neurons displayed a relative enrichment of classes of transcripts that included glutamate receptors, transporters, and interacting proteins, GABA receptors and transporters, synaptic-related markers, and catecholamine receptors and transporters. In contrast, the regional hippocampal dissection had an increased level of gene expression for cytoskeletal elements as well as glial-associated markers. Expression profile analysis illustrates the importance of evaluating individual cellular populations within a functional circuit and may help define elements that confer unique properties to individual populations of hippocampal neurons under normal and diseased conditions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Hippocampal pyramidal neurons are important for encoding and retrieval of spatial maps and episodic memories. While previous work has shown that Zbtb20 is a cell fate determinant for CA1 pyramidal neurons, the regulatory mechanisms governing this process are not known. In this study, we demonstrate that Zbtb20 binds to genes that control neuronal subtype specification in the developing isocortex, including Cux1, Cux2, Fezf2, Foxp2, Mef2c, Rorb, Satb2, Sox5, Tbr1, Tle4, and Zfpm2. We show that Zbtb20 represses these genes during ectopic CA1 pyramidal neuron development in transgenic mice. These data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which Zbtb20 suppresses the acquisition of an isocortical fate during archicortical neurogenesis to ensure commitment to a CA1 pyramidal neuron fate. We further show that the expression pattern of Zbtb20 is evolutionary conserved in the fetal human hippocampus, where it is complementary to the expression pattern of the Zbtb20 target gene Tbr1. Therefore, the disclosed Zbtb20-mediated transcriptional repressor mechanism may be involved in development of the human archicortex. ',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies in rodents have shown that there are significant differences in gene expression profiles between the hippocampal subregions CA1, CA3, and DG. These differences in molecular make-up within the hippocampus most likely underlie the differences in morphology, physiology, and vulnerability to insults that exist between the subregions of the hippocampus and are as such part of the basic molecular architecture of the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to investigate at large scale whether these subregional differences in gene expression are conserved in the hippocampus of a nonhuman primate, the common marmoset. This study is very timely, given the recent development of the first marmoset-specific DNA microarray, exclusively containing sequences targeting transcripts derived from the marmoset hippocampus. Hippocampal subregions CA1, CA3, and DG were isolated by laser microdissection and RNA was isolated, amplified, and hybridized to the marmoset-specific microarray (EUMAMA) containing more than 1,500 transcripts expressed in the adult marmoset hippocampus. Large differences in expression were observed in particular between the DG region and both pyramidal subregions. Moreover, the subregion-specific patterns of gene expression showed a remarkable conservation with the rodent brain both in terms of individual genes and degree of differential expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating large scale hippocampal gene expression in a nonhuman primate. The obtained expression profiles not only provide novel data on the expression of more than 1,500 transcripts per hippocampal subregion but also are of potential interest to neuroscientists interested in the role of the different subregions in learning and memory in the nonhuman primate brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Defective autophagy contributes to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis although evidence is conflicting on whether multiple stages are impaired. Here, for the first time, we have comprehensively evaluated the entire autophagic process specifically in CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus from early and late-stage AD subjects and nondemented controls. CA1 neurons aspirated by laser capture microdissection were analyzed using a custom-designed microarray comprising 578 neuropathology- and neuroscience-associated genes. Striking upregulation of autophagy-related genes, exceeding that of other gene ontology groups, reflected increases in autophagosome formation and lysosomal biogenesis beginning at early AD stages. Upregulated autophagosome formation was further indicated by elevated gene and protein expression levels for autophagosome components and increased LC3-positive puncta. Increased lysosomal biogenesis was evidenced by activation of MiTF/TFE family transcriptional regulators, particularly TFE3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3) and by elevated expression of their target genes and encoded proteins. Notably, TFEB (transcription factor EB) activation was associated more strongly with glia than neurons. These findings establish that autophagic sequestration is both competent and upregulated in AD. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion is not evidently altered. Despite this early disease response, however, autophagy flux is progressively impeded due to deficient substrate clearance, as reflected by autolysosomal accumulation of LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 and expansion of autolysosomal size and total area. We propose that sustained induction of autophagy in the face of progressively declining lysosomal clearance of substrates explains the uncommonly robust autophagic pathology and neuritic dystrophy implicated in AD pathogenesis.',\n",

Hippocampal damage was prevented in rats that had been preconditioned by brief seizures on 2 consecutive days before SE. To identify neuroprotective genes and biochemical pathways changed after preconditioning we compared the effect of preconditioning on gene expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal and DGCLs, harvested by laser capture microscopy. In the DGCL the expression of 632 genes was altered, compared to only 151 and 58 genes in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers. Most of the differentially expressed genes regulate tissue structure and intra- and extracellular signaling, including neurotransmission. A selective upregulation of energy metabolism transcripts occurred in CA1 pyramidal cells relative to the DGCL. These results reveal a broad transcriptional response of the DGCL to preconditioning, and suggest several mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of preconditioning seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To examine lesions caused by seizures in the developing brain, seizures were induced by the intraperitoneal injection of kainate and nicotine into juvenile mice. After a week, whole brain sections were examined using histochemistry and the gene expression profiles in the neocortices and hippocampi were analyzed using a DNA microarray. Propidium iodide and Fluoro-Jade C staining revealed that kainate but not nicotine-induced degeneration of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Comparative analyses of 12,488 probe sets on the microarray chip revealed the differential expression of 208 and 1243 probe sets in the neocortices and hippocampi of kainate-injected mice, respectively, as well as that of 535 and 436 probe sets in the neocortices and hippocampi of nicotine-injected mice, respectively, the patterns of change were largely drug-specific and region-specific. Among a variety of kainate-modified genes including those representing neurodegeneration and astrogliosis, we identified an increased gene expression of the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin S in the hippocampi of kainate-injected mice. Western blot analysis of the hippocampal homogenates revealed that kainate induced a 3.3-fold increase in cathepsin S expression. Immunohistochemistry using cell type-specific markers showed that cathepsin S was induced in microglia, especially those surrounding degenerating pyramidal neurons, but not in neurons themselves or astroglia, in the hippocampal CA1 region of kainate-injected mice. These results indicate that seizures induced by kainate elicit neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, and microglial activation accompanied by the expression of cathepsin S while those induced by nicotine do not.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus requires activity-dependent gene expression. We have therefore profiled gene expression in area CA1 following the induction of an electroshock-evoked maximal seizure. Using cDNA microarrays, the differential expression of approximately 9000 cDNAs was examined. In situ hybridization on 14 transcripts that showed strongest modulation in the microarray screen (1.8-2-fold) confirmed the differential expression of a single gene that encodes for the nuclear hormone receptor NGFI-B (Nur77, N10). Although this gene is only modestly up-regulated (approximately 2-fold) in area CA1, in situ hybridization revealed that maximal seizures induce a marked (approximately 12-fold) up-regulation of NGFI-B in the dentate gyrus. These data support the notion [French et al. (2001) Eur. J. Neurosci., 13, 968-976] that CA1 pyramidal neurons are more refractory than granule cells of the dentate gyrus with respect to activity-dependent gene transcription. Furthermore, our results argue against a large cohort of activity-dependent genes in area CA1.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To determine whether developmental hypothyroidism causes permanent disruption of neuronal development, we first performed a global gene expression profiling study targeting hippocampal CA1 neurons in male rats at the end of maternal exposure to anti-thyroid agents on weaning (postnatal day 20). As a result, genes associated with nervous system development, zinc ion binding, apoptosis and cell adhesion were commonly up- or down-regulated. Genes related to calcium ion binding were up-regulated and those for myelination were often down-regulated. We, then, examined immunohistochemical cellular distribution of Ephrin type A receptor 5 (EphA5) and Tachykinin receptor (Tacr)-3, those selected based on the gene expression profiles, in the hippocampal formation at the adult stage (11-week-old) as well as at the end of exposure. At weaning, both EphA5- and Tacr3-immunoreactive cells with strong intensities appeared in the pyramidal cell layer or stratum oriens of the hippocampal CA1 region. Although the magnitude of the change was decreased at the adult stage, Tacr3 in the CA1 region showed a sustained increase in expressing cells until the adult stage after developmental hypothyroidism. On the other hand, EphA5-expressing cells did not show sustained increase at the adult stage. The results suggest that developmental hypothyroidism caused sustained neuronal expression of Tacr3 in the hippocampal CA1 region, probably reflecting a neuroprotective mechanism for mismigration.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Reducing PRLR expression and JAK2 activity results in an increase in BDNF expression and inhibits the apoptosis of CA3 hippocampal neurons in a chronic mild stress model of depression.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Patients suffering from depression most commonly present with symptoms associated with the autonomic nervous system. Despite the satisfactory results achieved following treatment with vagus nerve stimulation and drug treatment, recurrence is a common occurrence in many patients. As described in numerous studies, prolactin receptor (PRLR) has been identified as an anxiolytic and anti-depressant factor in depression. However, the effect of PRLR on chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depression remains to be thoroughly demonstrated. Therefore, the present study was conducted on the effect of PRLR gene on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and hippocampal neuron apoptosis through the establishment of CMS-induced depression mouse models, with aims of providing a new and effective therapeutic option for depression. Microarray-based analysis was initially used to retrieve depression-related expression dataset and PRLR-related signaling pathway. Lentiviral vectors overexpressing PRLR or expressing PRLR-specific shRNA were used to up- or down-regulated the expression of PRLR in mice. Subsequently, the effects of PRLR on hippocampal neurons and pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3 regions, and ultrastructure in hippocampal region were evaluated. Serum BDNF level and the positive rate of cleaved-Caspase-3 in hippocampal CA3 region were determined. Next, the regulatory mechanism by which PRLR gene silencing influences hippocampal neuron apoptosis via the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway was detected. PRLR gene was assumed to participate in the development of depression by regulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Our results found that the mice with CMS-induced depression exhibited locomotion activity and anhedonia. In addition, a decrease in the number of pyramidal cells was observed in the hippocampus while that of apoptotic cells was increased. In addition, serum BDNF level was increased, and the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax in hippocampal neurons and the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway was decreased in response to PRLR silencing, along with increased expression of BDNF and Bcl-2. From the aforementioned findings, we concluded that PRLR gene silencing results in the inhibition of hippocampal neuron apoptosis and alleviation of CMS-induced depression by inactivating the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway and elevating BDNF expression, providing a new insight for the treatment of depression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The use of five histochemical stains (cresyl violet, thionin, hematoxylin & eosin, silver stain, and acridine orange) was evaluated in combination with an expression profiling paradigm that included regional and single cell analyses within the hippocampus of post-mortem human brains and adult mice. Adjacent serial sections of human and mouse hippocampus were labeled by histochemistry or neurofilament immunocytochemistry. These tissue sections were used as starting material for regional and single cell microdissection followed by a newly developed RNA amplification procedure (terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification) and subsequent hybridization to custom-designed cDNA arrays. Results indicated equivalent levels of global hybridization signal intensity and relative expression levels for individual genes for hippocampi stained by cresyl violet, thionin, and hematoxylin & eosin, and neurofilament immunocytochemistry. Moreover, no significant differences existed between the Nissl stains and neurofilament immunocytochemistry for individual CA1 neurons obtained via laser capture microdissection. In contrast, a marked decrement was observed in adjacent hippocampal sections stained for silver stain and acridine orange, both at the level of the regional dissection and at the CA1 neuron population level. Observations made on the cDNA array platform were validated by real-time qPCR using primers directed against beta-actin and glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase. Thus, this report demonstrated the utility of using specific Nissl stains, but not stains that bind RNA species directly, in both human and mouse brain tissues at the regional and cellular level for state-of-the-art molecular fingerprinting studies.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Early adverse experiences are thought to contribute to the development of stress vulnerability, and to increase the onset of stress-related psychiatric disorders in stressful environments in adulthood. One plausible molecular mechanism of stress vulnerability is the modulation of neurotrophic factor signal transduction in the hippocampus by early adversity. In the present study we investigated the influence of neonatal isolation (NI) with or without adulthood single restraint stress (SRS) on the expression of several growth factor-related genes in the rat hippocampus using a cDNA microarray, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot. We found that hippocampal insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) mRNA levels and immunoreactivity, and IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) mRNA levels were significantly lower in response to SRS in NI rats compared with rats without NI. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that hippocampal IGF-IR immunoreactivity in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers, and in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of NI rats subjected to SRS was significantly lower compared with rats subjected to SRS. In addition, the hippocampal levels of IGF-IR mRNA were significantly lower in adult rats subjected to NI. These findings indicate that NI down-regulates IGF signal transduction under basal and stressful conditions in later life. Since the activation of IGF signalling plays a role in the development and neuroprotection of the central nervous system, the down-regulation of IGF signal transduction induced by NI may be, at least in part, involved in the development of adulthood stress vulnerability, which in turn precipitates the onset of depression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chronic restraint stress in mice affects hippocampal structure and function. Mice were subjected to daily restraint for 3 weeks, and gene expression in hippocampus was compared to controls using large-scale cDNA microarrays. We found that 444 genes were differentially expressed, and further analysis of 6 genes by real-time reverse transcription PCR confirmed that 3 of them were downregulated by stress. These 3 genes, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type 1 beta (Pip5k1b), and glutathione S-transferase, pi2 (Gstp2), were also analyzed by in situ hybridization. The downregulation of Gstp2 may induce an increase of oxidative damage in the pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 regions and granular layer of the dentate gyrus, leading to structural and functional damage. Those regions are affected by stress, and our results could help understand further the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of stress-related disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Research indicates that female risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is greater than that of males. Moderate reduction of calorie intake, known as calorie restriction (CR), reduces pathology in AD mouse models and is a potentially translatable prevention measure for individuals at-risk for AD, as well as an important tool for understanding how the brain endogenously attenuates age-related pathology. Whether sex influences the response to CR remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the effect of CR on beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) pathology and hippocampal CA1 neuron specific gene expression in the Tg2576 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. Relative to ad libitum (AL) feeding, CR feeding significantly reduced hippocampal Aβ burden in 15-month-old female, but not age-matched male, Tg2576 mice. Sustained CR also significantly reduced expression of presenilin enhancer 2 (Psenen) and presenilin 1, components of the γ-secretase complex, in Tg2576 females. These results indicate that long-term CR significantly reduces age-dependent female Tg2576 Aβ pathology, which is likely to involve CR-mediated reductions in γ-secretase-dependent amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism. \",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal subregions are selectively vulnerable in certain disease states. To investigate, we tested the hypothesis that selective vulnerability in human hippocampus is related to regional differences in neuronal cell death and cell receptor gene expression in CA1 vs. CA3 subregions. We used laser capture microdissection to remove approximately 600 CA1 and 600 CA3 pyramidal neurons each from five fresh-frozen normal post-mortem brains, extracted total RNA and double-amplified mRNA. This was reverse transcribed and labeled for hybridization onto human cDNA array chips containing probes to 10,174 genes and unknown ESTs. RNA from additional microdissections was pooled for replicate hybridizations and quantitative RT-PCR validation. Gene expression differences were few (< 1%). We found 43 enriched genes in CA1 neuronal samples that included peripheral benzodiazipine receptor-associated protein, nicotinic cholinergic receptor, two chemokine receptors (CCR1 and CCR5) and several transcriptional factors. We found 17 enriched genes in the CA3 neuronal samples that included fibroblast growth factor receptor and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1. We found no differential gene expression for 23 calcium channel proteins; nine transporter proteins; 55 cell death and apoptotic regulator proteins; and an additional 497 cell receptors, including 24 glutamate receptors. Quantitative RT-PCR of four differentially expressed genes confirmed the microarray data. The results confirm the ability to examine gene expression profiles in microdissected neurons from human autopsy brain. They show only minor gene expression differences between two distinct neuronal populations in the hippocampus and suggest that selective hippocampal vulnerability is due to factors other than intrinsic differential expression in glutamate receptors and cell death genes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Schizophrenia is a disorder in which disturbances in the integration of emotion with cognition plays a central role and probably involves several different regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, the hippocampal formation, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Recent brain imaging studies have reported changes in volume, whereas postmortem studies point to dysfunction of the GABA and glutamate systems in these regions. Microarray-based profiles indicate that complex changes in the expression of genes associated with synaptic transmission and ion channels are involved in GABA cell dysfunction in schizophrenics. Molecular abnormalities vary considerably on the basis of sector and layer, suggesting that the unique connectivity of intrinsic and extrinsic afferents may critical in regulating the activity of genes in specific subpopulations of GABA cells. Projections of the BLA may be of particular importance to the induction of abnormal circuitry in schizophrenia, as their ingrowth during late adolescence and early adulthood may help to 'trigger' the onset of illness in susceptible individuals. A preponderance of cellular and molecular abnormalities has been found in the stratum oriens (SO) of sectors CA3/2 in which BLA afferents provide a robust innervation. These observations have lead to the development of a rodent model for the study of abnormal circuitry in this disorder. For example, single-cell recordings in hippocampal slices exposed to increased activation from the BLA have shown decreases in GABA currents in pyramidal neurons in SO of CA3/2, but not CA1, and support the validity of this model. Overall, the postmortem studies of neural circuitry abnormalities in schizophrenia are beginning to implicate specific cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological mechanism in specific subtypes of cortical neurons defined by their afferent and efferent connectivity within key corticolimbic regions.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Age-related decline in dopamine receptor levels has been observed in regional studies of animal and human brains; however, identifying specific cellular substrates and/or alterations in distinct neuronal populations remains elusive. To evaluate whether age-related decreases in dopamine receptor subtypes are associated with specific cell populations in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, antisense RNA amplification was combined with cDNA array analysis to examine effects of aging on D1-D5 dopamine receptor mRNA expression levels in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and entorhinal cortex layer II stellate cells from post-mortem human brains (19-92 years). In CA1 pyramidal neurons, significant age-related decline was observed for dopamine receptor mRNAs (D1-D4, P < 0.001; D5, P < 0.05) but not for the cytoskeletal elements beta-actin, three-repeat (3R) tau, and four-repeat (4R) tau. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in stellate cells across the same cohort. Thus, senescence may be a factor responsible for cell-specific decrements in dopamine receptor gene expression in one population of neurons within a circuit that is critical for learning and memory. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that alterations in dopaminergic function may also be related to behavioral abnormalities, such as psychosis, that occur with aging.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The issue of possible neurobiological effects of the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is highly controversial. To determine whether electromagnetic field exposure could act as an environmental stimulus capable of producing stress responses, we employed the hippocampus, a sensitive target of electromagnetic radiation, to assess the changes in its stress-related gene and protein expression after EMF exposure. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with body restrained were exposed to a 2.45 GHz EMF at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 6 W/kg or sham conditions. cDNA microarray was performed to examine the changes of gene expression involved in the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation. Of 2048 candidate genes, 23 upregulated and 18 downregulated genes were identified. Of these differential expression genes, two heat shock proteins (HSP), HSP27 and HSP70, are notable because expression levels of both proteins are increased in the rat hippocampus. Result from immunocytochemistry revealed that EMF caused intensive staining for HSP27 and HSP70 in the hippocampus, especially in the pyramidal neurons of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and granular cells of dentate gyrus (DG). The gene and protein expression profiles of HSP27 and HSP70 were further confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Our data provide direct evidence that exposure to electromagnetic fields elicits a stress response in the rat hippocampus.',\n",

The mRNA from individual active caspase 3(+)/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling [TUNEL(-)] and active caspase 3(+)/TUNEL(+) pyramidal and granule neurons in brain-injured mice were amplified and compared with those from nonlabeled neurons in uninjured brains. Gene analysis revealed that overall expression of mRNAs increased with activation of caspase 3 and decreased to below uninjured levels with TUNEL reactivity. Cell type specificity of the apoptotic response was observed with both regionally distinct expression of mRNAs and differences in those mRNAs that were maximally regulated. Immunohistochemical analysis for two of the most highly differentially expressed genes (prion and Sos2) demonstrated a correlation between the observed differential gene expression after traumatic brain injury and corresponding protein translation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Developmental cuprizone (CPZ) exposure impairs rat hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we captured the developmental neurotoxicity profile of CPZ using a region-specific expression microarray analysis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, corpus callosum, cerebral cortex and cerebellar vermis of rat offspring exposed to 0, 0.1, or 0.4% CPZ in the maternal diet from gestation day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. Transcripts of those genes identified as altered were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis on PNDs 21 and 77. Our results showed that transcripts for myelinogenesis-related genes, including Cnp, were selectively downregulated in the cerebral cortex by CPZ at ≥0.1% or 0.4% on PND 21. CPZ at 0.4% decreased immunostaining intensity for 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and CNPase(+) and OLIG2(+) oligodendrocyte densities in the cerebral cortex, whereas CNPase immunostaining intensity alone was decreased in the corpus callosum. By contrast, a striking transcript upregulation for Klotho gene and an increased density of Klotho(+) oligodendrocytes were detected in the corpus callosum at ≥0.1%. In the dentate gyrus, CPZ at ≥0.1% or 0.4% decreased the transcript levels for Gria1, Grin2a and Ptgs2, genes related to the synapse and synaptic transmission, and the number of GRIA1(+) and GRIN2A(+) hilar γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons and cyclooxygenase-2(+) granule cells. All changes were reversed at PND 77. Thus, developmental CPZ exposure reversibly decreased mature oligodendrocytes in both cortical and white matter tissues, and Klotho protected white matter oligodendrocyte growth. CPZ also reversibly targeted glutamatergic signals of GABAergic interneuron to affect dentate gyrus neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in granule cells. \",\n",

To better understand the molecular changes that may be necessary for the clinical effectiveness of ECS we have combined the technologies of gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays with T7-based RNA amplification and laser microdissection to identify regulated genes in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of the hippocampus. We have identified genes previously reported to be up-regulated following ECS, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neuropeptide Y, and thyrotrophin releasing hormone, as well as several novel genes. Notably, we have identified additional genes that are known to be involved in neuroprotection, such as growth arrest DNA damage inducible beta (Gadd45beta), and the excitatory amino acid transporter-1 (EAAC1/Slc1A1). In addition, via in situ hybridization we show that EAAC1 is specifically up-regulated in the dentate gyrus, but not in other hippocampal subfields. This study demonstrates the utility of microarray analysis of microdissected subregions of limbic brain regions and identifies novel ECS-regulated genes.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Dissection of hippocampal dentate gyrus from adult mouse.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"The hippocampus is one of the most widely studied areas in the brain because of its important functional role in memory processing and learning, its remarkable neuronal cell plasticity, and its involvement in epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders. The hippocampus is composed of distinct regions; the dentate gyrus, which comprises mainly granule neurons, and Ammon's horn, which comprises mainly pyramidal neurons, and the two regions are connected by both anatomic and functional circuits. Many different mRNAs and proteins are selectively expressed in the dentate gyrus, and the dentate gyrus is a site of adult neurogenesis; that is, new neurons are continually generated in the adult dentate gyrus. To investigate mRNA and protein expression specific to the dentate gyrus, laser capture microdissection is often used. This method has some limitations, however, such as the need for special apparatuses and complicated handling procedures. In this video-recorded protocol, we demonstrate a dissection technique for removing the dentate gyrus from adult mouse under a stereomicroscope. Dentate gyrus samples prepared using this technique are suitable for any assay, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and cell biology analyses. We confirmed that the dissected tissue is dentate gyrus by conducting real-time PCR of dentate gyrus-specific genes, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) and desmoplakin (Dsp), and Ammon's horn enriched genes, Meis-related gene 1b (Mrg1b) and TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase 3 (Tyro3). The mRNA expressions of TDO2 and Dsp in the dentate gyrus samples were detected at obviously higher levels, whereas Mrg1b and Tyro3 were lower levels, than those in the Ammon's horn samples. To demonstrate the advantage of this method, we performed DNA microarray analysis using samples of whole hippocampus and dentate gyrus. The mRNA expression of TDO2 and Dsp, which are expressed selectively in the dentate gyrus, in the whole hippocampus of alpha-CaMKII+/- mice, exhibited 0.037 and 0.10-fold changes compared to that of wild-type mice, respectively. In the isolated dentate gyrus, however, these expressions exhibited 0.011 and 0.021-fold changes compared to that of wild-type mice, demonstrating that gene expression changes in dentate gyrus can be detected with greater sensitivity. Taken together, this convenient and accurate dissection technique can be reliably used for studies focused on the dentate gyrus.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A learning event initiates a cascade of altered gene expression leading to synaptic remodelling within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, a structure vital to memory formation. To illuminate this transcriptional program of synaptic plasticity we used microarrays to quantify mRNA from the rat dentate gyrus at increasing times following passive avoidance learning. Approximately, 500 known genes were transcriptionally regulated across the 24 h post-training period. The 0-2 h period saw up-regulation of genes involved in transcription while genes with a role in synaptic/cytoskeletal structure increased 0-6 h, consistent with structural rearrangements known to occur at these times. The most striking feature was the profound down-regulation, across all functional groups, 12 h post-training. Bioinformatics analysis identified the likely transcription factors controlling gene expression in each post-training period. The role of NF kappa B, implicated in the early post-training period was subsequently confirmed with activation and nuclear translocation seen in dentate granule neurons following training. mRNA changes for four genes, LRP3 (0 h), alpha actin (3 h), SNAP25 and NSF (6-12 h), were validated at message and/or protein level and shown to be learning specific. Thus, the memory-associated transcriptional cascade supports the cardinal periods of synaptic loosening, reorganisation and selection thought to underpin the process of long-term memory consolidation in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential regulation of mature and precursor microRNA expression by NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptor activation during LTP in the adult dentate gyrus in vivo.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Regulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression and function in the context of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult brain is little understood. Here, we examined miRNA expression during long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of adult anesthetized rats. Microarray expression profiling identified a subpopulation of regulated mature miRNAs 2 h after the induction of LTP by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the medial perforant pathway. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed modest upregulation of miR-132 and miR-212, and downregulation of miR-219, while no changes occurred at 10 min post-HFS. Surprisingly, pharmacological blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP enhanced expression of these mature miRNAs. This HFS-evoked expression was abolished by local infusion of the group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist, (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA). AIDA had no effect on LTP induction or maintenance, but blocked activity-dependent depotentiation of LTP. Turning to the analysis of miRNA precursors, we show that HFS elicits 50-fold elevations of primary (pri) and precursor (pre) miR-132/212 that is transcription dependent and mGluR dependent, but insensitive to NMDAR blockade. Primary miR-219 expression was unchanged during LTP. In situ hybridization showed upregulation of the pri-miR-132/212 cluster restricted to dentate granule cell somata. Thus, HFS induces transcription miR-132/212 that is mGluR dependent and functionally correlated with depotentiation rather than LTP. In contrast, NMDAR activation selectively downregulates mature miR-132, -212 and -219 levels, indicating accelerated decay of these mature miRNAs. This study demonstrates differential regulation of primary and mature miRNA expression by mGluR and NMDAR signaling following LTP induction, the function of which remains to be defined.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have shown that maternal manganese (Mn) exposure caused sustained disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis of mouse offspring. To clarify the effects of maternal Mn exposure on epigenetic gene regulation contributing to the sustained disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis, we treated pregnant ICR mice with MnCl₂ in diet from gestational day 10 through day 21 after delivery on weaning and searched epigenetically downregulated genes by global promoter methylation analysis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male offspring on postnatal day (PND) 21 and PND 77. By CpG promoter microarray analysis on PND 21 following 800-ppm Mn exposure, sustained promoter hypermethylation and transcript downregulation through PND 77 were confirmed with Mid1, Atp1a3, and Nr2f1, whereas Pvalb showed a transient hypermethylation only on weaning. The numbers of Pvalb⁺ and ATP1a3⁺ neurons suggestive of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons, Mid1⁺ cells suggestive of late-stage granule cell lineage and GABAergic interneurons, and COUP-TF1⁺ cells suggestive of early-stage granule cell lineage were all reduced on PND 21, and reductions were sustained on PND 77 except for no change in Pvalb⁺ cells. Mid1⁺ cells showed asymmetric distribution with right-side predominance, and Mn exposure abolished it by promoter hypermethylation of the right side. These findings indicate epigenetic mechanisms as mediators, through which Mn exposure modulates neurogenesis involving both granule cell lineage and GABAergic interneurons with long-lasting and stable repercussions. Disruption of asymmetric cellular distribution of Mid1 suggests that higher brain functions specialized in the left or right side of the brain were affected.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Identification of genes co-upregulated with Arc during BDNF-induced long-term potentiation in adult rat dentate gyrus in vivo.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical regulator of transcription-dependent adaptive neuronal responses, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Brief infusion of BDNF into the dentate gyrus of adult anesthetized rats triggers stable LTP at medial perforant path-granule synapses that is transcription-dependent and requires induction of the immediate early gene Arc. Rather than acting alone, Arc is likely to be part of a larger BDNF-induced transcriptional program. Here, we used cDNA microarray expression profiling to search for genes co-upregulated with Arc 3 h after BDNF-LTP induction. Of nine cDNAs encoding for known genes and up-regulated more than four-fold, we selected five genes, Narp, neuritin, ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein-4 (ARL4L), TGF-beta-induced immediate early gene-1 (TIEG1) and CARP, for further validation. Real-time PCR confirmed robust up-regulation of these genes in an independent set of BDNF-LTP experiments, whereas infusion of the control protein cytochrome C had no effect. In situ hybridization histochemistry further revealed up-regulation of all five genes in somata of post-synaptic granule cells following both BDNF-LTP and high-frequency stimulation-induced LTP. While Arc synthesis is critical for local actin polymerization and stable LTP formation, several of the co-upregulated genes have known functions in excitatory synaptogenesis, axon guidance and glutamate receptor clustering. These results provide novel insight into gene expression responses underlying BDNF-induced synaptic consolidation in the adult brain in vivo.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Synaptic consolidation refers to the development and stabilization of protein synthesis-dependent modifications of synaptic strength as observed during long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength are thought to underlie memory storage and other adaptive responses of the nervous systems of importance in mood stability, reward behavior, and pain control. This chapter focuses on the mechanisms and functions of synaptic consolidation in the dentate gyrus, a critical structure not only in hippocampal memory function, but also in regulation of stress responses and cognitive aspects of depression. Recent evidence suggests that synaptic consolidation at excitatory medial perforant path-granule cell synapses requires brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and induction of the immediate early gene activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Arc mRNA is strongly induced and transported to dendritic processes following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) that induces LTP in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo. Sustained synthesis of Arc during a surprisingly protracted time-window is required for hyperphosphorylation of actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin and local expansion of the actin cytoskeleton in vivo. Furthermore, this process of Arc-dependent synaptic consolidation is activated in response to brief infusion of BDNF. Microarray expression profiling has revealed a panel of BDNF-regulated genes that may cooperate with Arc during synaptic consolidation. In addition to regulating gene expression, BDNF signaling modulates the fine localization and biochemical activation of the translation machinery. By modulating the spatial and temporal translation of newly induced (Arc) and constitutively-expressed mRNA in dendrites, BDNF may effectively control the window of synaptic consolidation. Dysregulation of BDNF synthesis and Arc function, specifically within the dentate gyrus, is linked to behavioral symptoms and cognitive deficits in animal models of depression and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutics strategies targeting synaptic consolidation hold promise for the future.\",\n",

We used laser capture microdissection and an antidepressant-related genes microarray to analyze gene expression profiles of cells from the SGZ and from the outermost granule cell layer.

Neuroserpin immunoreactivity was present in cells positive for NeuN (postmitotic cell marker) and Tuj1 (immature neuron marker) but not in cells positive for calbindin (mature neuron marker).

       "  'Abstract': \"The neuronal RNA-binding protein HuD plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of short-lived mRNAs during the initial establishment and remodelling of neural connections. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing this protein (HuD-Tg) in adult DGCs (dentate granule cells) and shown that their mossy fibres contain high levels of GAP-43 (growth-associated protein 43) and exhibit distinct morphological and electrophysiological properties. To investigate the basis for these changes and identify other molecular targets of HuD, DGCs from HuD-Tg and control mice were collected by LCM (laser capture microscopy) and RNAs analysed using DNA microarrays. Results show that 216 known mRNAs transcripts and 63 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) are significantly up-regulated in DGCs from these transgenic mice. Analyses of the 3'-UTRs (3'-untranslated regions) of these transcripts revealed an increased number of HuD-binding sites and the presence of several known instability-conferring sequences. Among these, the mRNA for TTR (transthyretin) shows the highest level of up-regulation, as confirmed by qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ISH (in situ hybridization). GO (gene ontology) analyses of up-regulated transcripts revealed a large over-representation of genes associated with neural development and axogenesis. In correlation with these gene expression changes, we found an increased length of the infrapyramidal mossy fibre bundle in HuD-Tg mice. These results support the notion that HuD stabilizes a number of developmentally regulated mRNAs in DGCs, resulting in increased axonal elongation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Hemizygous deletion of a 3 Mb region of 22q11.2 is found in 1/4000 humans and produces 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). Up to 35% of 22q11DS patients develop schizophrenia, making it the second highest risk factor for schizophrenia. A mouse model for 22q11DS, the Df1/+ mouse, carries a hemizygous deletion in a region syntenic with the human deletion. Df1/+ mice are mostly viable but display deficits in prepulse inhibition and learning and memory, two common traits of schizophrenia thought to result, at least in part, from defects in hippocampal neurons. We used oligonucleotide microarrays and QRT-PCR to evaluate gene expression changes in hippocampal dentate granule neurons of Df1/+ mice versus wild-type littermates (n=12/group). The expression of only 287 genes changed with p value significance below 0.05 by microarray, yet 12 of the 21 Df1 region genes represented on the array showed highly significantly reduced expression compared to wild-type controls (33% on average, p values from 10(-3) to 10(-7)). Variants in two of these genes, COMT and PRODH, have been linked with schizophrenia. Overlap of the 287 genes with the reportedly reduced expression of mitochondrial, ubiquitin/proteasome, and synaptic plasticity genes in schizophrenia dentate granule neurons, was not significant. However, modest increases in expression of mitochondrial electron transport genes were observed in the Df1/+ mice. This perhaps indicates a compensation for mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the strongly reduced expression of the Df1 region-encoded mitochondrial enzymes proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) and thioredoxin reductase 2 (Txnrd2).',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Excitotoxicity by which excitatory amino acid induces neuronal cell death may underlie mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously found that c-fos is critically involved in neuronal excitability and survival. Mice that carry hippocampal mutations of c-fos exhibited hyper-excitability, hyper-excitotoxicity and higher mortality in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures compared to wild-type mice. To further understand the neuroprotective signal transduction pathways regulated by c-fos in the hippocampal formation, we identified 172 genes that are either regulated by KA or are differentially expressed in wild-type and hippocampal-specific c-fos mutant mice using cDNA microarrays. One gene encodes the neuropeptide Y (NPY). We confirmed that c-fos regulates the expression of NPY by using immunohistochemistry. We found that c-fos is critical in up-regulation of NPY expression in the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus in response to KA administration. As NPY is an important endogenous anti-epileptic agent, our result is consistent with a hypothesis that the neuroprotective function of c-fos is mediated in part by regulation of NPY expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an area of active proliferation and neurogenesis within the adult brain. The molecular events controlling adult cell genesis in the hippocampus essentially remain unknown. It has been reported previously that adult male and female rats from the strains Sprague Dawley (SD) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) have a marked difference in proliferation rates of cells in the hippocampal DG. To exploit this natural variability and identify potential regulators of cell genesis in the hippocampus, hippocampal gene expression from male SHR as well as male and female SD rats was analyzed using a cDNA array strategy. Hippocampal expression of the gene-encoding glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) varied strongly in parallel with cell-proliferation rates in the adult rat DG. Moreover, robust GIP immunoreactivity could be detected in the DG. The GIP receptor is expressed by cultured adult hippocampal progenitors and throughout the granule cell layer of the DG, including progenitor cells. Thus, these cells have the ability to respond to GIP. Indeed, exogenously delivered GIP induced proliferation of adult-derived hippocampal progenitors in vivo as well as in vitro, and adult GIP receptor knock-out mice exhibit a significantly lower number of newborn cells in the hippocampal DG compared with wild-type mice. This investigation demonstrates the presence of GIP in the brain for the first time and provides evidence for a regulatory function for GIP in progenitor cell proliferation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neonatal Borna disease (NBD) virus infection in the Lewis rat results in life-long viral persistence and causes behavioral and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. A hallmark of the disorder is progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje and dentate gyrus granule cells. Findings of increased brain metallothionein-I and -II (MT-I/-II) mRNA expression in cDNA microarray experiments led us to investigate MT isoforms and their relationship to brain zinc metabolism, cellular toxicity, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in this model. Real-time PCR confirmed marked induction of MT-I/-II mRNA expression in the brains of NBD rats (40.5-fold increase in cerebellum, p<0.0001; 6.8-fold increase in hippocampus, p=0.003; and 9.5-fold increase in striatum, p=0.0012), whereas a trend toward decreased MT-III mRNA was found in hippocampus (1.25-fold decrease, p=0.0841). Double label immunofluorescence revealed prominent MT-I/-II expression in astrocytes throughout the brain; MT-III protein was decreased in granule cell neurons and increased in astrocytes, with differential subcellular distribution from cytoplasmic to nuclear compartments in NBD rat hippocampus. Modified Timm staining of hippocampus revealed reduced zinc in mossy fiber projections to the hilus and CA3, accumulation of zinc in glial cells and degenerating granule cell somata, and robust mossy fiber sprouting into the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Zinc Transporter 3 (ZnT-3) mRNA expression was decreased in hippocampus (2.3-fold decrease, p= 0.0065); staining for its correlate protein was reduced in hippocampal mossy fibers. Furthermore, 2 molecules implicated in axonal pathfinding and mossy fiber sprouting, the extracellular matrix glycoprotein, tenascin-R (TN-R), and the hyaluronan receptor CD44, were increased in NBD hippocampal neuropil. Abnormal zinc metabolism and mechanisms of neuroplasticity may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease in this model, raising more general implications for neurodevelopmental damage following viral infections in early life.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN1 is an obligatory component of NMDARs without a known functional homolog and is expressed in almost every neuronal cell type. The NMDAR system is a coincidence detector with critical roles in spatial learning and synaptic plasticity. Its coincidence detection property is crucial for the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We have generated a mutant mouse model expressing a hypomorph of the Grin1(N598R) allele, which leads to a minority (about 10%) of coincidence detection-impaired NMDARs. Surprisingly, these animals revealed specific functional changes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampal formation. Early LTP was expressed normally in area CA1 in vivo, but was completely suppressed at perforant path-granule cell synapses in the DG. In addition, there was a pronounced reduction in the amplitude of the evoked population spike in the DG. These specific changes were accompanied by behavioral impairments in spatial recognition, spatial learning, reversal learning, and retention. Our data show that minor changes in GluN1-dependent NMDAR physiology can cause dramatic consequences in synaptic signaling in a subregion-specific fashion despite the nonredundant nature of the GluN1 gene and its global expression.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Gene expression profiles of transcripts in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice: up-regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and apoptotic genes is an early cellular change in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the impairment of cognitive functions and by beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. Our objective was to determine genes that are critical for cellular changes in AD progression, with particular emphasis on changes early in disease progression. We investigated an established amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse model (the Tg2576 mouse model) for gene expression profiles at three stages of disease progression: long before (2 months of age), immediately before (5 months) and after (18 months) the appearance of Abeta plaques. Using cDNA microarray techniques, we measured mRNA levels in 11 283 cDNA clones from the cerebral cortex of Tg2576 mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at each of the three time points. This gene expression analysis revealed that the genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism and apoptosis were up-regulated in 2-month-old Tg2576 mice and that the same genes were up-regulated at 5 and 18 months of age. These microarray results were confirmed using northern blot analysis. Results from in situ hybridization of mitochondrial genes-ATPase-6, heat-shock protein 86 and programmed cell death gene 8-suggest that the granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex are up-regulated in Tg2576 mice compared with WT mice. Results from double-labeling in situ hybridization suggest that in Tg2576 mice only selective, over-expressed neurons with the mitochondrial gene ATPase-6 undergo oxidative damage. These results, therefore, suggest that mitochondrial energy metabolism is impaired by the expression of mutant APP and/or Abeta, and that the up-regulation of mitochondrial genes is a compensatory response. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanism of Abeta toxicity in AD and for developing therapeutic strategies for AD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus is involved in the encoding, storage, and retrieval of memory. Here, we have developed a novel mapping method for detecting the distribution of neural activity of the entire population of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 and subiculum regions, where expression profiles of Arc mRNA were used as an indicator of neural activity. The spherical pyramidal cell layer of the intact hippocampus was flattened into a two-dimensional plane, which was then serially sectioned in parallel with the plane to make tangential sections. Tangential sections were hybridized with an Arc cRNA probe and Arc signals from serial tangential sections were stacked and displayed on a two-dimensional plane, allowing one to easily visualize the neural activity of all pyramidal cells. We applied this method to the hippocampus of rats that had experienced contextual fear conditioning, which requires hippocampal function. We observed a net shift of Arc signals from dorsal to ventral CA1/subiculum with an interval prolongation to reconditioning after the initial conditioning. The reconditioning-revealed shift may reflect a reorganization process, which takes place during the period between initial conditioning and reconditioning, in the CA1/subiculum neural network that represents the neural storage and/or retrieval of the contextual fear conditioning.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules. The RAGE-ligand interaction has a putative role in a range of chronic disorders and is also known to contribute to both inflammatory/degenerative processes as well as regeneration in peripheral nerve injury. We have investigated the expression of RAGE in the moderate hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rat brain injury model in order to determine if this receptor is involved in the cellular perturbation mediated by ischemic stress. RAGE mRNA levels were detected by in situ hybridization using a DIG-labelled 48 mer oligonucleotide probe. Results showed a high level of expression of RAGE mRNA in the CA1/2 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus on the lesioned side of the brain 72 h after a moderate hypoxic-ischemic insult. RAGE was not expressed on the control side of the hippocampus. The RAGE-positive cells had a unique morphology, being angular in shape and atrophied with a condensed cell nucleus. They were NeuN-positive and were identified as dying cells by staining with thionin/acid fuchsin. A subset of cells was positive for cleaved Caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis. Together these data show that RAGE is expressed in dying neurons and suggest that RAGE may have a role in neuronal cell death mediated by ischemic stress. Identification of the ligand for RAGE in the ischemic brain may lead to a better understanding of RAGE-mediated cellular dysfunction in the CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) is an attractive guidance molecule for cortical apical dendrites. To elucidate the role of Sema3A in hippocampal dendritic formation, we examined the Sema3A expression pattern in the perinatal hippocampal formation and analyzed hippocampal dendrites of the brains from young adult sema3A mutant mice. Sema3A protein was predominantly expressed in the hippocampal plate and the inner marginal zone at the initial period of apical dendritic growth. Neuropilin-1 and plexin-A, the receptor components for Sema3A, were also localized in the same regions. The Golgi impregnation method revealed that in wildtype mice more than 90% of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons extended a single trunk or apical trunks bifurcated in stratum radiatum. Seven percent of the pyramidal neurons showed proximal bifurcation of apical trunks in stratum pyramidale or at the border of the stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum. In sema3A mutant mice, proximally bifurcated apical dendrites were increased to 32%, while the single apical dendritic pyramidal neurons were decreased. We designate this phenotype in sema3A mutant mice as \"proximal bifurcation.\" In the dissociated culture system, approximately half of the hippocampal neurons from wildtype mice resembled pyramidal neurons, which possess a long, thick, and tapered dendrite. In contrast, only 30% of the neurons from sema3A mutants exhibited pyramidal-like morphology. Proximal bifurcation of CA1 pyramidal neurons was also increased in the mutant mice of p35, an activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Thus, Sema3A may facilitate the initial growth of CA1 apical dendrites via the activation of p35/Cdk5, which may in turn signal hippocampal development.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential dendritic targeting of AMPA receptor subunit mRNAs in adult rat hippocampal principal neurons and interneurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In hippocampal neurons, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory postsynaptic responses at glutamatergic synapses, and are involved in various forms of synaptic plasticity. Dendritic local protein synthesis of selected AMPAR subunit mRNAs is considered an additional mechanism to independently and rapidly control the strength of individual synapses. We have used fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to analyze the localization of AMPAR subunit (GluA1-4) mRNAs and their relationship with the translation machinery in principal cells and interneurons of the adult rat hippocampus. The mRNAs encoding all four AMPAR subunits were detected in the somata and dendrites of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells and those of six classes of CA1 γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons. GluA1-4 subunit mRNAs were highly localized to the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, whereas in interneurons they were present in multiple dendrites. In contrast, in the dentate gyrus, GluA1-4 subunit mRNAs were virtually restricted to the somata and were absent from the dendrites of granule cells. These different regional and cell type-specific labeling patterns also correlated with the localization of markers for components of the protein synthesis machinery. Our results support the local translation of GluA1-4 mRNAs in dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells and CA1 interneurons but not in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, the regional and cell type-specific differences we observed suggest that each cell type uses distinct ways of regulating the local translation of AMPAR subunits.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Role of protein kinase C in modulation of excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Biochemical and in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that the levels of protein kinase C variants were significantly increased in the hippocampus of the experimental models of epilepsy in rats. In addition it has been demonstrated that protein kinase C plays an important role in modulating synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We examined the effects of activating of protein kinase C on the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons and synaptic transmission, using whole-cell current-clamp and extracellular field potential recording techniques. Indolactam V (1 microM) a novel protein kinase C activator, increased the excitability of CA1 neurons acting at both pre- and post-synaptic sites. Indolactam V, acting postsynaptically, significantly reduced the threshold for initiation of action potential from -42+/-3.8 mV to -51+/-3.1 mV and selectively inhibited the slow afterhyperpolarizing potential. Indolactam V also altered the neuronal firing properties in response to prolonged depolarizing pulse by eliminating the spike frequency accommodation. Our data indicate that indolactam V potentiated both amplitudes of Shaffer-collateral stimulation evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents and disynaptically evoked inhibitory evoked postsynaptic currents. However, the potentiation of inhibitory evoked postsynaptic currents amplitudes was not observed after blockade of NMDA and AMPA/kainate currents suggesting it was due to excitatory activity driving inhibitory neurons. The results indicate that the potentiation of pharmacologically isolated excitatory postsynaptic currents (215% of control) and amplitudes of population spikes (290% of control) was due to action of indolactam V presynaptically since the agonist reduced the paired-pulse ratio and the potentiating effect was not blocked by dialyzing the postsynaptic neuron through the recording electrode with a specific protein kinase C inactivator calphostin C. These findings suggest that protein kinase C increases the amplitude of epileptiform activity by causing potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission, increasing the excitability of postsynaptic neurons and reducing negative feed back provided by slow afterhyperpolarizing potential.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Chronic stress differentially alters mRNA expression of opioid peptides and receptors in the dorsal hippocampus of female and male rats.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex-dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus, which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (∼2.5 months old ) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1-was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK-expressing and fewer OPRD1-expressing granule cells and more OPRM1-expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: (1) PENK-expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; (2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and (3) OPRK1-expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: (1) PDYN expression in granule cells; (2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; (3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and (4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex-specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Heterotopic or aberrantly positioned cortical neurons are associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Various mouse models exist with forms of heterotopia, but the composition and state of cells developing in heterotopic bands has been little studied. Dcx knockout (KO) mice show hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell lamination abnormalities, appearing from the age of E17.5, and mice suffer from spontaneous epilepsy. The Dcx KO CA3 region is organized in two distinct pyramidal cell layers, resembling a heterotopic situation, and exhibits hyperexcitability. Here, we characterized the abnormally organized cells in postnatal mouse brains. Electron microscopy confirmed that the Dcx KO CA3 layers at postnatal day (P) 0 are distinct and separated by an intermediate layer devoid of neuronal somata. We found that organization and cytoplasm content of pyramidal neurons in each layer were altered compared to wild type (WT) cells. Less regular nuclei and differences in mitochondria and Golgi apparatuses were identified. Each Dcx KO CA3 layer at P0 contained pyramidal neurons but also other closely apposed cells, displaying different morphologies. Quantitative PCR and immunodetections revealed increased numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and interneurons in close proximity to Dcx KO pyramidal cells. Immunohistochemistry experiments also showed that caspase-3 dependent cell death was increased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of Dcx KO hippocampi at P2. Thus, unsuspected ultrastructural abnormalities and cellular heterogeneity may lead to abnormal neuronal function and survival in this model, which together may contribute to the development of hyperexcitability.

       "  'Abstract': 'Place cells in the hippocampus can maintain multiple representations of a single environment and respond to physical and/or trajectory changes by remapping. Within the hippocampus there are anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral dissociations between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and within dorsal CA1. Arc expression was used to measure the recruitment of ensembles across different hippocampal subregions in rats trained to utilize two different cognitive strategies while traversing an identical trajectory. This behavioral paradigm allowed for the measurement of remapping in the absence of changes in external cues, trajectory traversed (future/past), running speed, motivation, or different stages of learning. Changes in task demands induced remapping in only some hippocampal regions: reorganization of cell ensembles was observed in dorsal CA1 but not in dorsal CA3. Moreover, a gradient was found in the degree of remapping within dorsal CA1 that corresponds to entorhinal connectivity to this region. Remapping was not seen in the ventral hippocampus: neither ventral CA1 nor CA3 exhibited ensemble changes with different cognitive demands. This contrasts with findings of remapping in both the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus using this task. The results suggest that the dorsal pole of the hippocampus is more sensitive to changes in task demands.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We investigated the changes in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its receptor, VEGFR-3, in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia. The expression profiles of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were very similar in the control hippocampi, where both genes were constitutively expressed in neurons in the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of VEGF-C was similar to that of VEGFR-3 in the ischemic hippocampus, and in the CA1 and dentate hilar regions both VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were strongly expressed in activated glial cells rather than in neurons. Most of the activated glial cells expressing both genes were reactive astrocytes, although some were a subpopulation of brain macrophages. In the dentate gyrus, however, VEGFR-3 expression was transiently increased in the innermost layer of granule cells on days 7-10 after reperfusion, coinciding with an increase in polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule staining--a marker for immature neurons. These data suggest that VEGF-C may be involved in glial reaction via paracrine or autocrine mechanisms in the ischemic brain and may carry out specific roles in adult hippocampal neurogenesis during ischemic insults.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of death and disability worldwide and often associated with post-traumatic epilepsy. We recently demonstrated that TBI induces acquired GABAA receptors channelopathy that associates with hyperexcitability in granule cell layer (GCL). We now assessed the expression of GABAA and GABAB receptor subunit mRNAs between 6 h and 6 months post-TBI in the hippocampus and thalamus. The expression of major GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs (α1, α2, α5, β2, β3, γ2 and δ) was, often bilaterally, down-regulated in the GCL and in the CA3 pyramidal cells. Instead, expression of α4 (GCL, CA3, CA1), α5 (CA1) and γ2 (GCL, CA3, CA1) mRNA was up-regulated after 10 d and/or 4 months. Many of these changes were reversible. In the thalamus, we found decreases in α1, α4, β2, γ2 and δ mRNAs in the laterodorsal thalamus and in the area combining the posterior thalamic nuclear group, ventroposterolateral and ventroposteromedial complex at 6 h to 4 months post-TBI. Unlike in the hippocampus, thalamic subunit down-regulations were irreversible and limited to the ipsilateral side. However, contralaterally there was up-regulation of the subunits δ and α4 6 h and 4 months after TBI, respectively. PCR array analysis suggested a mild long-lasting GABAA receptor channelopathy in the GCL and thalamus after TBI. Whereas TBI induces transient changes in the expression of GABAA receptor subunits in the hippocampus (presumably representing compensatory mechanisms), alterations of GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the thalamus are long-lasting and related to degeneration of receptor-containing neurons in thalamo-cortical relay nuclei.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Identification of the molecular mechanisms that enable synchronous firing of CA1 pyramidal neurons is central to the understanding of the functional properties of this major hippocampal output pathway. Using microfluorescence measurements of intraneuronal pH, in situ hybridization, as well as intracellular, extracellular, and K+-sensitive microelectrode recordings, we show now that the capability for synchronous gamma-frequency (20-80 Hz) firing in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) emerges abruptly in the rat hippocampus at approximately postnatal day 12. This was attributable to a steep developmental upregulation of intrapyramidal carbonic anhydrase isoform VII, which acts as a key molecule in the generation of HFS-induced tonic GABAergic excitation. These results point to a crucial role for the developmental expression of intrapyramidal carbonic anhydrase VII activity in shaping integrative functions, long-term plasticity and susceptibility to epileptogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The type II classic cadherin subfamily contains a number of extensively studied genes (cdh6, cdh8, cdh11); however, the expression and function of the other members have only been partially described. Here we employed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization to characterize cortical and hippocampal expression of all type II cadherins (with the exception of the nonneural Cdh5) in the developing and adult mouse brain. Many of these genes have ubiquitous mRNA distribution patterns throughout development, indicating high functional redundancy, which might be necessary for safe production of the strictly laminated structure of these regions. A few of the genes examined, however, exhibit a unique spatiotemporal pattern of expression, particularly during cortical development, indicating a potentially specific function. In the developing and adult hippocampus, almost all of these genes are strongly expressed in glutamatergic neurons of the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layer and the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, there are significant expression differences within the GABAergic cells of the adult hippocampus. Our results indicate that selective expression of type II cadherins may generate a flexible cell-adhesion machinery for developing neurons to selectively bind to each other, but can also provide a high level of security due to the multiple overlaps in the expression domains.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cell adhesion molecule, CHL1, like its close homologue L1, is important for normal brain development and function. In this study, we analysed the functional role of CHL1 in synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus using juvenile CHL1-deficient (CHL1-/-) and wild-type (CHL1+/+) mice. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents evoked in pyramidal cells by minimal stimulation of perisomatically projecting interneurons were increased in CHL1-/- mice compared with wild-type littermates. Also, long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses was reduced under physiological conditions in CHL1-/- mice. This abnormality was abolished by application of a GABAA receptor antagonist, suggesting that enhanced inhibition is the cause of LTP impairment. Quantitative ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses revealed aberrations possibly related to the abnormally high inhibition observed in CHL1-/- mice. The length and linear density of active zones in symmetric synapses on pyramidal cell bodies, as well as number of perisomatic puncta containing inhibitory axonal markers were increased. Density and total number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons was also abnormally high. These observations and the finding that CA1 interneurons express CHL1 protein indicate that CHL1 is important for regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission and interneuron populations in the postnatal brain. The observed enhancement of inhibitory transmission in CHL1-/- mice is in contrast to the previous finding of reduced inhibition in L1 deficient mice and indicates different functions of these two closely related molecules.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Enkephalins (ENKs) are endogenous opioids that regulate synaptic excitability of GABAergic networks in the cerebral cortex. Using retrograde tracer injections in the subiculum, we identified a hippocampal population of ENK-expressing projection neurons. In situ hybridization for GAD shows that ENK-expressing cells are a small GABAergic subpopulation. Furthermore, by extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling in vivo, we identified an ENK-expressing cell in stratum radiatum of the CA1 area by its complete axodendritic arborization and characteristic spike timing during network oscillations. The somatodendritic membrane was immunopositive for mGluR1alpha, and there was both a rich local axon in CA1 and subicular-projecting branches. The boutons showed cell-type- and layer-specific innervation, i.e., interneurons were the main targets in the alveus, both interneurons and pyramidal cell dendrites were innervated in the other layers, and interneurons were exclusive targets in the subiculum. Parvalbumin-, but not somatostatin-, calbindin-, or cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons were preferred synaptic targets. During network activity, the juxtacellularly labeled ENK-expressing cell was phase modulated throughout theta oscillations, but silenced during sharp-wave/ripple episodes. After these episodes the interneuron exhibited rebound activity of high-frequency spike bursts, presumably causing peptide release. The ENK-expressing interneurons innervating parvalbumin-positive interneurons might contribute to the organization of the sharp-wave/ripple episodes by decreased firing during and rebound activity after the ripple episodes, as well as to the coordination of activity between the CA1 and subicular areas during network oscillations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Selegiline (L-deprenyl) has shown neuroprotective effects in a variety of degenerative processes. The present experiments were designed to test whether post-ischemia administered selegiline would alleviate delayed neuronal death of the gerbil hippocampal pyramidal cells following transient global ischemia. Common carotid arteries were occluded for 5 min. Saline or selegiline, 0.25 mg/kg s.c., was administered 2 h after the ischemia followed by a daily injection for either 3 or 7 days. After decapitation, the delayed death of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells was assessed using Nissl-stained sections. In situ hybridization was used to reveal the expression of hsp70 mRNA 1, 3 or 7 days after the ischemia. Animals treated with selegiline for 7 days showed significantly lower damage score (scale 0-3: 0, normal; 1, < 10% of the neurons damaged; 2, 10-50% damaged; 3, > 50% damaged) compared to the saline-treated animals 1.73 +/- 0.18 and 2.41 +/- 0.16 (mean +/- S.E.M., P = 0.0133), respectively. A similar trend was found in animals after the 3-day treatment: 1.68 +/- 0.32 vs. 2.06 +/- 0.25 (P > 0.5). The expression of hsp70 mRNA in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer was strong still 3 days after the ischemic insult but vanished by 7 days. Densitometric measurements using 14C-plastic standards showed that the intensity of the CA1a hsp70 signal on the 3rd day correlated negatively to the cell-damage score (r = -0.72, P < 0.001), suggesting that hsp70 does not serve as a quantitative marker for CA1 neuronal injury in this model. Instead, the hsp70 expression was associated with improved neuronal survival lasting often longer in selegiline-treated animals (P > 0.5). The results show that a low dose of selegiline can alleviate the delayed hippocampal neuronal death in gerbils when administered 2 h after an ischemic insult.',\n",

In this study, we examined the relative levels and localization of Noggin mRNA in the hippocampus of rats of different developmental stages with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. RT-PCR showed that the peak level of expression of Noggin mRNA was observed at embryonic day 13 (E13), subsequently gradually declined at 1-3 months (P1-3M) postnatal, and was detected only at a low level at P18M. In situ hybridization revealed that at embryonic stages, Noggin mRNA was localized throughout all hippocampal regions, whereas at early postnatal ages, Noggin mRNA was primarily localized in the anterior subiculum. At later postnatal ages, Noggin mRNA expression was obviously observed in the dentate gyrus and in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layers. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Noggin is expressed in embryonic and postnatal hippocampus, and that the temporal and spatial patterns of its expression is developmentally regulated.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We studied expression of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in cortical and limbic areas of the brain of the tree shrew. In situ hybridization with a receptor-specific probe and immunocytochemistry with various antibodies was used to identify distinct neurons expressing the receptor. In vitro receptor autoradiography with (3)H-8-OH-DPAT ((3)H-8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin) was performed to visualize receptor-binding sites. In the prefrontal, insular, and occipital cortex, 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA was expressed in pyramidal neurons of layer 2, whereas (3)H-8-OH-DPAT labeled layers 1 and 2 generating a columnar-like pattern in the prefrontal and occipital cortex. In the striate and ventral occipital cortex, receptor mRNA was present within layers 5 and 6 in pyramidal neurons and Meynert cells. Pyramid-like neurons in the claustrum and anterior olfactory nucleus also expressed the receptor. Principal neurons in hippocampal region CA1 expressed 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA, and (3)H-8-OH-DPAT labeled both the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum. CA3 pyramidal neurons displayed low 5-HT(1A) receptor expression, whereas granule neurons in the dentate gyrus revealed moderate expression of this receptor. In the amygdala, large pyramid-like neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus strongly expressed the receptor. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against parvalbumin, calbindin, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) provided no evidence for 5-HT(1A) receptor expression in GABAergic neurons in cortical and limbic brain areas. Our data agree with previous findings showing that the 5-HT(1A) receptor mediates the modulation of glutamatergic neurons. Expression in the limbic and cortical areas suggested an involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors in emotional and cognitive processes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamatergic receptors that have been implicated in learning, development, and neuropathological conditions. They are typically composed of GluN1 and GluN2A-D subunits. Whereas a great deal is known about the role of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs, much less is known about GluN2D-containing NMDARs. Here we explore the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs on hippocampal interneurons. GluN2D mRNA was detected by single-cell PCR and in situ hybridization in diverse interneuron subtypes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The GluN2D subunit was detectable by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry in all subfields of the hippocampus in young and adult mice. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acute hippocampal slices, (+)-CIQ, the active enantiomer of the positive allosteric modulator CIQ, significantly enhanced the amplitude of the NMDAR component of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in CA1 interneurons but not in pyramidal cells. (+)-CIQ had no effect in slices from Grin2d-/- mice, suggesting that GluN2D-containing NMDARs participate in excitatory synaptic transmission onto hippocampal interneurons. The time course of the NMDAR component of the mEPSC was unaffected by (+)-CIQ potentiation and was not accelerated in slices from Grin2d-/- mice compared with wild-type, suggesting that GluN2D does not detectably slow the NMDAR EPSC time course at this age. (+)-CIQ increased the activity of CA1 interneurons as detected by the rate and net charge transfer of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells. These data provide evidence that interneurons contain synaptic NMDARs possessing a GluN2D subunit, which can influence interneuron function and signal processing.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurons are often classified by their morphological and molecular properties. The online knowledge base Hippocampome.org primarily defines neuron types from the rodent hippocampal formation based on their main neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA) and the spatial distributions of their axons and dendrites. For each neuron type, this open-access resource reports any and all published information regarding the presence or absence of known molecular markers, including calcium-binding proteins, neuropeptides, receptors, channels, transcription factors, and other molecules of biomedical relevance. The resulting chemical profile is relatively sparse: even for the best studied neuron types, the expression or lack thereof of fewer than 70 molecules has been firmly established to date. The mouse genome-wide in situ hybridization mapping of the Allen Brain Atlas provides a wealth of data that, when appropriately analyzed, can substantially augment the molecular marker knowledge in Hippocampome.org. Here we focus on the principal cell layers of dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, and CA1, which together contain approximately 90% of hippocampal neurons. These four anatomical parcels are densely packed with somata of mostly excitatory projection neurons. Thus, gene expression data for those layers can be justifiably linked to the respective principal neuron types: granule cells in DG and pyramidal cells in CA3, CA2, and CA1. In order to enable consistent interpretation across genes and regions, we screened the whole-genome dataset against known molecular markers of those neuron types. The resulting threshold values allow over 6000 very-high confidence (>99.5%) expressed/not-expressed assignments, expanding the biochemical information content of Hippocampome.org more than five-fold. Many of these newly identified molecular markers are potential pharmacological targets for major neurological and psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, our approach yields reasonable expression/non-expression estimates for every single gene in each of these four neuron types with >90% average confidence, providing a considerably complete genetic characterization of hippocampal principal neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), a proneural gene controlled by the Notch receptor, is implicated in the control of dendrite morphology and synaptic plasticity of cultured hippocampal neurons. Here we report the localization and subcellular distribution of Ngn3 in the hippocampus in vivo and in neuronal cultures. In situ hybridization showed Ngn3 mRNA expression in the pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus of adult mouse hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that Ngn3 localization is mostly cytoplasmic in the hippocampal eminence at embryonic day (E)17 and postnatal day (P)0. At P10 it is cytoplasmic in CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons and nuclear in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In the adult hippocampus Ngn3 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of both pyramidal neurons and granule cells. During development of cultured hippocampal neurons, Ngn3 mRNA expression is higher at stages of neuronal polarization, as judged by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and it is mostly cytoplasmic. The tracking of the subcellular localization of Ngn3 in neurons infected with a virus expressing myc-Ngn3 suggests that the protein is quickly translocated to the cell nucleus after synthesis and then reexported to the cytoplasm. Treatment with leptomycin B, a potent and specific inhibitor of the exportin CRM1, induced its accumulation into the nucleus, suggesting that CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of Ngn3. These results suggest that Ngn3 may play a role in neuronal development by actions in the cytoplasm.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Several studies have demonstrated anatomical and functional segregation along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus. This study examined the possible differences in the AMPA and NMDA receptor subunit composition and receptor binding parameters between dorsal and ventral hippocampus, since several evidence suggest diversification of NMDA receptor-dependent processes between the two hippocampal poles. Three sets of rat dorsal and ventral hippocampus slices were prepared: 1) transverse slices for examining a) the expression of the AMPA (GluRA, GluRB, GluRC) and NMDA (NR1, NR2A, NR2B) subunits mRNA using in situ hybridization, b) the protein expression of NR2A and NR2B subunits using Western blotting, and c) by using quantitative autoradiography, c(1)) the specific binding of the AMPA receptor agonist [(3)H]AMPA and c(2)) the specific binding of the NMDA receptor antagonist [(3)H]MK-801, 2) longitudinal slices containing only the cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) region for performing [(3)H]MK-801 saturation experiments and 3) transverse slices for electrophysiological measures of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Ventral compared with dorsal hippocampus showed for NMDA receptors: 1) lower levels of mRNA and protein expression for NR2A and NR2B subunits in CA1 with the ratio of NR2A /NR2B differing between the two poles and 2) lower levels of [(3)H]MK-801 binding in the ventral hippocampus, with the lowest value observed in CA1, apparently resulting from a decreased receptor density since the B(max) value was lower in ventral hippocampus. For the AMPA receptors CA1 our results showed in ventral hippocampus compared with dorsal hippocampus: 1) lower levels of mRNA expression for GluRA, GluRB and GluRC subunits, which were more pronounced in CA1 and in dentate gyrus region and 2) lower levels of [(3)H]AMPA binding. Intracellular recordings obtained from pyramidal neurons in CA1 showed longer NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials in ventral hippocampus compared with dorsal hippocampus. In conclusion, the differences in the subunit mRNA and protein expression of NMDA and AMPA receptors as well as the lower density of their binding sites observed in ventral hippocampus compared with dorsal hippocampus suggest that the glutamatergic function differs between the two hippocampal poles. Consistently, the lower value of the ratio NR2A/NR2B seen in the ventral part would imply that the ventral hippocampus NMDA receptor subtype is functionally different than the dorsal hippocampus subtype, as supported by our intracellular recordings. This could be related to the lower ability of ventral hippocampus for long-term synaptic plasticity and to the higher involvement of the NMDA receptors in the epileptiform discharges, observed in ventral hippocampus compared with dorsal hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The properties of the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) and its roles in hippocampal network function evolve radically during development. Because I(h) is conducted by the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels, we tested the hypothesis that understanding the quantitative developmental profiles of HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 expression, and the isoform- and age-specific progression of their subcellular distribution, should shed light on the established modifications of the properties of I(h) throughout development. Combined quantitative in situ hybridization, regional western blots, and high-resolution, dual-label immunocytochemistry revealed striking and novel information about the expression and distribution of the HCN channel isoforms in the developing hippocampal formation. In cornus ammon 1 (CA) pyramidal cell layer, a robust increase of HCN1 mRNA and protein expression occurred with age, with reciprocal reduction of HCN4 and relatively stable HCN2 levels. These distinct expression patterns raised the contribution of HCN1 to the total HCN channel pool from 33% to 65% consonant with acceleration and reduced cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) sensitivity of I(h) in this region with age. In CA3, strong expression of HCN1 already neonatally supports the recently established role of this conductance in neonatal, age-specific, hippocampal oscillations (giant depolarizing potentials). Notably, HCN1 channels were present and probably transported to dendritic compartments already on postnatal day (P) 2, whereas HCN2 channel protein was not evident in dendrites for the first 2 weeks of life. HCN2 mRNA and protein expression remained fairly constant subsequent to the first week of life in all hippocampal subfields examined, whereas HCN4 mRNA and protein expression declined after maximal neonatal expression, so that the contribution of this isoform to the total HCN channel pool dropped from 43% (CA1) and 34% (CA3) on P11 to 8% (CA1) and 19% (CA3) on P90. Interneuronal expression of all HCN channel isoforms in stratum pyramidale was robust in parvalbumin-but not in cholecystokinin-expressing populations and with a subunit-specific subcellular distribution. Taken together, these data suggest that early in life, HCN4 may contribute significantly to the functions of I(h) in specific hippocampal regions. In addition, these evolving, differential quantitative, and subcellular expression patterns of the HCN channel isoforms support age-specific properties and functions of I(h) within the developing hippocampal formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chronic stress is associated with impairment of synapse plasticity in hippocampus and cognitive dysfunction in rodent and human. Notably, corticosterone (CORT) is believed to take responsibility for dendritic atrophy and reduction of spine number induced by chronic stress in hippocampus. But little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying CORT induced abnormal synapse plasticity and cognitive dysfunction. Drebrin is an F-actin binding protein that modulates memory formation and maintenance by controlling the genesis and morphology of dendritic spines. In addition, miRNAs have been reported to participate in the negative regulation of protein-coding genes. In this study, five miRNAs capable of targeting Drebrin were selected by searching miRNA databases. One of these miRNAs, miR-19b-3p, was found to be upregulated in the hippocampal neurons of mice with chronic restraint stress (CRS). Luciferase reporter assay and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed to identify the interaction between miR-19b-3p and Drebrin. In addition, silencing miR-19b-3p expression in vivo using an antagomir or in vitro using an inhibitor increased Drebrin expression, ameliorated the abnormal dendritic structure and upregulated the spine density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of CRS mice and primary hippocampal neurons cultured under CORT stimulation, respectively. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that inhibition of miR-19b-3p rescued the limited synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, blocking miR-19b-3p drastically protected against cognitive deficits in CRS mice. These in vivo and in vitro findings indicate that the upregulation of miR-19b-3p exacerbates CRS-induced abnormal synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment by targeting Drebrin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Changes in cellular uptake of glutamate following transient cerebral ischemia is of possible importance to ischemia induced cell death. In the present study, we employed in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to investigate the influence of cerebral ischemia on expression of mRNA and protein of the astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1, and of glial fibrillary acidic protein. Different subfields of CA1 and CA3 of the rat hippocampus were studied at various time-points after ischemia (days 1, 2, 4, and 21). In CA1, GLT1-mRNA was decreased at all time-points after ischemia except from day 2, whereas in CA3, decreases were seen only on day 1. Expression of GLT1-protein in CA1 was unchanged during the initial days after ischemia, but decreased markedly from day 2 to 4. In CA3, GLT1-protein increased progressively throughout the observation period after ischemia. Following the degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells, a positive correlation between the number of CA1 pyramidal cells and expression of either GLT1-mRNA or -protein was evident selectively in CA1. Increases in expression of mRNA and protein of glial fibrillary acidic protein were present from day 2, most notable in CA1. The present data provide evidence that expression of GLT1 in CA1 of the hippocampus is not decreased persistently before the degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells, but is downregulated in response to loss of these neurons. Since the reduction in GLT1 expression evolved concomitantly with the degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells, it may contribute to the severity of CA1 pyramidal cell loss. A progressive postischemic increase in GLT1 expression in CA3 may be linked to the resistance of CA3 neurons to ischemic cell damage.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The growth-associated protein GAP-43 is a presynaptic membrane phosphoprotein that is expressed at high levels during development and axonal growth. To evaluate the cellular distribution of GAP-43 mRNA in the hippocampus and cerebellum of adult rats we applied in situ hybridization (ISH) as well as direct and indirect in situ RT-PCR using biotin as a reporter molecule. ISH resulted in a positive signal in most cerebellar granular cells and in 30% of hippocampal CA3 neurons. Direct in situ RT-PCR yielded cells with strong signals in every region investigated, with elevated background levels most likely related to incorporation of labeled nucleotides into non-specific amplicons through internal priming and DNA repair activity. Indirect in situ RT-PCR turned out to be the best approach for detecting GAP-43 mRNA positive cells. Cerebellar cells exhibiting a positive signal for GAP-43 mRNA were of the granular cell type (98%). Hippocampal neurons with a positive reaction for GAP-43 mRNA included all the neuron groups analyzed, namely CA1 (99%) and CA3 pyramidal cells (94%) and dentate gyrus granule cells (92%). Dentate gyrus granule cells have not tested positive for GAP-43 mRNA detection by molecular morphology analysis. These data show that in normal rats GAP-43 mRNA is present in different cell populations of hippocampal formation, supporting the role of this protein in the ongoing processes of synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"In recent years, Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) has emerged as one of the most promising candidate genes whose disruption confers an increased risk for schizophrenia. Cell biology studies have implicated DISC1 in key neurodevelopmental processes including neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration. In situ hybridization analysis has revealed that Disc1 is expressed in the hypothalamus, olfactory bulbs, the developing cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. The hippocampus is of particular interest because abnormalities in hippocampal volume and function have been consistently reported in schizophrenics. Moreover, DISC1 mutations have been associated with abnormal activation of the hippocampus in humans. Given the involvement of the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, there is an intriguing possibility that disruption of DISC1 may increase schizophrenia susceptibility by altering the normal development and function of the hippocampus. In order to contribute to our understanding of DISC1's role in the hippocampus, we have performed a detailed analysis of the Disc1 expression pattern in the mouse hippocampus throughout development. We report that Disc1 is expressed throughout the hippocampus during embryonic development, with expression becoming increasingly specialized in Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus granule cells within the first postnatal week. This expression pattern remains consistent into adulthood, with a noted decrease in Disc1 expression in the adult CA1. Disc1 is also expressed in proliferating cells in the adult subgranular zone, as well as in a subset of GABAergic interneurons. Our results are the first report of a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of the ontogeny of Disc1 expression within the hippocampus.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A recently identified neuronal Na+-dependent phosphate cotransporter (rBNPI) has been shown to import inorganic phosphate (P(i)) required for the production of high-energy phosphates which are vital to neuronal energy metabolism. In the present study, we have examined the expression of rBNPI mRNA in the hippocampus of rats subjected to 30 min of global ischemia by four-vessel occlusion. In situ hybridization reveals that transient forebrain ischemia results in a selective reduction in rBNPI mRNA expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Expression of rBNPI is significantly reduced by 24 h and completely absent at 72 h following global ischemia when CA1 pyramidal neurons begin to show cell damage. By contrast, there is no change in the expression of Nedd2 mRNA, a developmentally regulated cell death gene, in CA1 pyramidal neurons at these same time points. The loss of rBNPI transcripts appears to be selective for CA1 pyramidal neurons since rBNPI mRNA expression is unchanged in neurons of the CA2-CA4 pyramidal cell layers following global ischemia. Our data indicate that an early reduction of rBNPI transcripts may contribute to a reduction in P(i)-dependent energy metabolism or signal transduction which has been reported in CA1 hippocampal neurons following global ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ovarian hormones regulate pyramidal cell synapse formation and excitability and interneuronal GABAergic tone in the CA1 region of the adult female rat hippocampus. The role of 17beta-estradiol in these effects is complex and appears to involve a subset of hippocampal interneurons, which express different calcium-binding protein and neuropeptide phenotypes and nuclear estrogen receptor alpha. We found that, in the hippocampus, nuclear estrogen receptor alpha-immunoreactive interneurons co-express neuropeptide Y, calbindin-D28k and calretinin but do not parvalbumin or cholecystokinin. Moreover, a proportion of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive interneurons co-expresses calbindin-D28k and calretinin. This pattern is similar in the presence or absence of 17beta-estradiol treatment in ovariectomized rats. We then used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to determine whether 17beta-estradiol treatment regulates expression of CA1 interneuronal phenotypic markers via nuclear estrogen receptor alpha activation. We found that 17beta-estradiol treatment of ovariectomized rats increased neuropeptide Y mRNA levels (25%) and the neuropeptide Y mRNA-associated grain density per cell (11%), as well as the number of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive cells (11%), predominantly in the pyramidal cell layer (stratum pyramidale). Treatment with CI628, a selective estrogen response modulator that acts as an antagonist for nuclear estrogen receptor, blocked 17beta-estradiol-induced increase of neuropeptide Y mRNA levels. 17beta-Estradiol treatment did not alter the number of parvalbumin, calretinin, and cholecystokinin immunoreactive cells, nor mRNA levels for parvalbumin and cholecystokinin. Therefore, the present study has identified neuropeptide Y expression as the main interneuronal phenotype that co-expresses nuclear estrogen receptor alpha and shown that neuropeptide Y is responsive to 17beta-estradiol in CA1 pyramidal cell layer. We suggest that 17beta-estradiol may regulate neuropeptide Y expression mediated by nuclear estrogen receptor alpha-dependent activation in a subset of hippocampal interneurons, and we speculate that subsequent neuropeptide Y release may indirectly contribute to regulate glutamate-dependent neuronal activity in the adult rat hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '17beta-Estradiol spatiotemporally regulates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) tone in the adult hippocampus. However, the complex estrogenic effect on the GABAergic system is still unclear. In adult central nervous system (CNS) neurons, GABA can induce both inhibitory and excitatory actions, which are predominantly controlled by the cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2. We therefore studied the estrogenic regulation of two glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67, as well as NKCC1 and KCC2 in the adult female rat hippocampus by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. First, we focused on the duration after ovariectomy (OVX) and its effects on GAD65 protein levels. The basal number of GAD65-immunoreactive cells decreased after long-term (10 days) OVX compared to short-term (3 days) OVX. We found that, only after long-term OVX but not after short-term OVX, estradiol increased the number of GAD65-immunoreactive cells in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Furthermore, estradiol did not alter the GAD65-immunoreactive cell population in any other CA1 subregion. Second, we therefore focused on long-term OVX and the estrogenic regulation of GAD and cation-chloride cotransporter mRNA levels. In the pyramidal cell layer, estradiol affected GAD65, GAD67 and NKCC1 mRNA levels, but not KCC2 mRNA levels. Both GAD65 and NKCC1 mRNA levels increased within 24 h after estradiol treatment, followed by a subsequent increase in GAD67 mRNA levels. These findings suggest that basal levels of estrogen might contribute to a balance between the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission onto CA1 pyramidal cells by regulating perisomatic GAD and NKCC1 expression in the adult hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Chronic neonatal nicotine exposure increases mRNA expression of neurotrophic factors in the postnatal rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Nicotine, the psychoactive ingredient in tobacco, can be neuroprotective but the mechanism is unknown. In the adult hippocampus, chronic nicotine can increase expression of growth factors which could contribute to nicotine's neuroprotective effects. During development, nicotine could also increase expression of neurotrophic factors. Therefore, we determined whether chronic neonatal nicotine (CNN) exposure increased mRNA expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve-growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Nicotine (6 mg/kg/day in milk formula) or milk formula (controls) were delivered in three daily doses via oral gastric intubation to rat pups from postnatal day (P)1 to P8, and then sacrificed. Brains were processed for in situ hybridization using specific (35)S-labeled cRNA probes. At P8, CNN had a significant stimulant treatment effect on the expression of BDNF, FGF-2, NT-3 and IGF-1 [p<0.01], but not NGF. Specifically, BDNF mRNA expression, detected in CA1, CA3 stratum (s.) pyramidal and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), was increased by 27.4%, 23.26% and 27.3%, respectively. FGF-2 mRNA expression, detected in neurons and astrocytes in CA1 s. radiatum, CA2 and CA3 s. pyramidale, and molecular layer of the DG, was increased by 34.0%, 8.9%, 31.0% and 23.1%, respectively. NT-3 mRNA expression in CA2 s. pyramidale was increased by 80.0%, and CNN increased the number of IGF-1-expressing cells in CA1 (18.0%), CA3 (20.9%) and DG (17.7%). Thus, nicotine exposure during early postnatal development differentially up-regulated expression of neurotrophic factor mRNAs in the hippocampus, which could increase neurotrophic tone and alter developmental processes.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'The selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib reduces kainate-induced cell death in the rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Treatment of male Sprague-Dawley rats with kainic acid (10 mg/kg, i.p.) triggered limbic seizures in 60% of the animals starting within 30 min and lasting for about 6 h. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA was strongly induced in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, in the amygdala and the piriform cortex after 8 h, as shown by in situ hybridization, and returned to control levels after 72 h. At this time marked cell loss occurred in the CA1-CA3 areas of the hippocampus. We hypothesize that rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, might abbreviate the late neurotoxicity, possibly associated with COX-2 induction. Animals which developed seizures were treated for 3 days with rofecoxib (10 mg/kg, i.p., n = 12) starting 6 or 8 h after kainic acid injection. Histological staining of viable cells confirmed that rofecoxib treatment selectively diminished cell loss in the hippocampus. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique was used to estimate delayed cell death. Abundant TUNEL-positive cells were detected in seizure rats 72 h after kainic acid injection in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (CA1-CA3), in cells of the thalamus, the amygdala and the piriform cortex. Treatment with rofecoxib selectively and significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus, whereas the cells of the thalamus, amygdala and piriform cortex were not protected. Therefore we conclude that COX-2 might contribute to cell death of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus as a consequence of limbic seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The authors recently cloned a cDNA for an ICE/CED3-related cysteine protease from rat brain, which is closely related to human CPP32 (now designated caspase-3). In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed a profound developmental regulation of the caspase-3 transcript in rat brain, with relatively high levels of caspase-3 mRNA observed in neurons of the fetal and neonatal brain and low levels of mRNA in neurons of the adult brain. The authors report that transient forebrain ischemia, which results in a delayed apoptotic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons, results in prolonged expression of caspase-3 mRNA in these same pyramidal neurons. Up-regulation of caspase-3 mRNA in CA1 pyramidal neurons is prominent 24 hours after transient global ischemia, and expression is maintained at higher levels for at least 72 hours after ischemia. However, by 96 hours after ischemia, a marked decrease in caspase-3 mRNA expression is observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons, showing severe degenerative changes (e.g., nuclear condensation). By contrast, there is no change in the expression of a closely related member of caspase family, caspase-2, in CA1 pyramidal neurons after global ischemia. Instead, caspase-2 mRNA is induced in lamina layers of cerebral cortex 24 hours after the ischemia. A selective and prolonged induction of the caspase-3 gene in committed CA1 pyramidal neurons suggests that transcriptional activation of this caspase-3 gene may be involved in the apoptotic cell death cascade of CA1 neurons after transient global ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'An increase in L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (LTCC) current is a prominent biomarker of brain aging and is believed to contribute to cognitive decline and vulnerability to neuropathologies. Studies examining age-related changes in LTCCs have focused primarily on males, although estrogen (17beta-estradiol, E2) affects calcium-dependent activities associated with cognition. Therefore, to better understand brain aging in females, the effects of chronic E2 replacement on LTCC current activity in hippocampal neurons of young and aged ovariectomized rats were determined. The zipper slice preparation was used to expose cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) pyramidal neurons for recording LTCC currents using the cell-attached patch-clamp technique. We found that an age-related increase in LTCC current in neurons from control animals was prevented by E2 treatment. In addition, in situ hybridization revealed that within stratum pyramidale of the CA1 area, mRNA expression of the Ca(v)1.2 LTCC subunit, but not the Ca(v)1.3 subunit, was decreased in aged E2-treated rats. Thus, the reported benefits of E2 on cognition and neuronal health may be attributed, at least in part, to its age-related decrease in LTCC current.',\n",

Alpha and PKC beta are members of the group A PKC genes that were first described; PKC epsilon is a member of the group B PKC genes that were more recently identified by molecular cloning. A combination of all three gene products and their mRNAs overlapped in their distributions in dentate granule cells and pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons. However, each subspecies predominated in one of the major cell types. PKC alpha-immunoreactivity and mRNA were most intense in CA2-3 pyramidal cells and dendrites, whereas PKC beta-immunoreactivity and mRNA were most intense in CA1 pyramidal cells and dendrites. PKC epsilon-immunoreactivity and mRNA were concentrated in dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells. Furthermore, PKC epsilon-immunoreactivity was detectable in mossy fibers. Each subspecies labeled different kinds of interneurons that were particularly numerous in, but not restricted to, the hilus.

       "  'Title': 'The role of signal transduction in the delayed necrosis of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells following transient ischemia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'A short period of cerebral ischemia leads to necrosis of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Until recently no mechanisms contributing to this selective vulnerability were known. During the last decade an increasing amount of research has been concentrated on identifying signs of disturbed signal transduction in these neurons after ischemia. The present thesis is a review of these studies with some emphasis on my own contributions to the field. Gerbil and rat models of transient global ischemia are the most frequently employed. In order to produce the selective necrosis the main arteries to the brain are occluded for 5-20 minutes. In the rat it is often also necessary to lower the blood pressure. It takes 2-7 days of recirculation before the CA1 pyramidal cells become necrotic. The studies show that the necrosis can be attenuated or aggravated by drugs acting as inhibitors or enhancers of signal transduction--also if administered shortly after ischemia. The necrosis can be similarly influenced by lesions of excitatory or inhibitory afferent neurons. The protective effect of the lesion however, can be due to the lesion-induced decrease in metabolism. During ischemia there is an increase in the extracellular concentration of several excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters as well as in intracellular second messengers. Some of the latter also show an increase during recirculation. In vitro autoradiographic studies of receptor proteins show either unchanged or diffusely distributed downregulation of the ligand binding to the various extra- and intracellular receptor proteins following ischemia and early recirculation. A second decrease is seen in the CA1 at the time of and probably secondary to the necrosis. The IP3 receptor decrease appears during the first minutes of recirculation and lasts for up to 14 days. The protective lesion of the excitatory afferents from CA3 also leads to a decrease in IP3 binding. The changes in receptor regulation are not accompanied by increased postischemic electrophysiological activity in the CA1. In vivo autoradiographic mapping of the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose show increased metabolism in the CA1 during the first hour of recirculation compared to the rest of the brain were it is depressed. This relative hypermetabolism is not seen if the CA1 has been deprived of its primary source of excitatory afferents. A later secondary increase seen in the more or less necrotic CA1 pyramidal cell layer is probably due to macrophage activity. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies on the expression of c-fos mRNA and protein respectively has been used to depict neurons with increased activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Estradiol is involved in the differentiation and plasticity of hippocampal neurons. In the CA1 region, estrogen treatment increases dendritic spines and synapse density on pyramidal cells. In the adult hippocampus, immunoreactivity for estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) has been reported in inhibitory interneurons, but neither in the pyramidal neurons nor in granule cells. Estrogens also mediate aspects of sexual differentiation of the hippocampus. To examine the possibility that an alteration in expression of the two types of estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) in the hippocampus underlies different roles of estrogen and/or ERs during development and in adult life, we applied non-isotopic, digoxigenin (dig)-labeled, in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) for the both ER forms and examined the distribution pattern of their messages in serial, frontal sections over the postnatal period and in the adult. ERalpha mRNA expression was found scattered throughout the hippocampus especially in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus, and in the strata radiatum and pyramidale in the cornus ammonis at postnatal days (PND) 14, 21 and 35. In the hilus of the dorsal hippocampus, the density of ERalpha-labelled cells was greater in the rostro-medial aspect, while less in the lateral and the caudal region. In the ventral hippocampus the signals for ERalpha mRNA were also found in relatively high density in the hilus. No significant sex difference in distribution and intensity of the ERalpha mRNA positive cells were detected. The hippocampal distribution of ERalpha mRNA expression at PND 14 remained the same on PND 21 and 35 and in adulthood. As reported for adults, ERalpha mRNA signals appear to be in interneurons of the hippocampus but neither in the pyramidal cells nor in the dentate granular cells based on their size and location. In contrast to the result of ERalpha, no clear signals for ERbeta mRNA were detected in the hippocampus across all ages examined, whereas they were clearly detected in the hypothalamus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"It has been suggested that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor family plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis that is essential for memory, learning, differentiation, and development. Although gene expression of these receptors has been analyzed in the experimental animal brain and in some diseases of the adult or elderly human brain, it has not been studied in the developing human brain. Using in situ hybridization, we investigated the expression of the NMDAR1 gene in the hippocampi of 16 human neonates who were between 22 and 40 weeks of gestation and had no evidence of critical episodes of brain insult at autopsy. Signals for NMDAR1 were detected ubiquitously at all developmental stages. Dense hybridization signals were uniformly detected in the granular cells of the dentate gyrus in all specimens. Stronger signals were observed in the larger-type pyramidal cells in the CA2 and CA3 regions compared with the pattern seen in the CA1 region in the smaller-type pyramidal cells. These results suggest that the NMDAR1 gene is expressed at 22 weeks and possibly occurs earlier in neuronal cell bodies of the dentate gyrus and all CA fields of Ammon's horn and that the NMDAR plays an important role in constructing neuronal networks in developing human brains.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study characterizes the distribution of the two tyrosine kinase receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Flt-1 and Flk-1, in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia. The semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of Flt-1 and Flk-1 in hippocampal CA1 showed upregulation of these receptors following ischemic injury. Expression of Flt-1 and Flk-1 mRNA was restricted to neurons in the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers in control animals; however, upregulation was detected in activated glial cells and in the vascular endothelial cells rather than in neurons, in ischemic hippocampi. Most of the activated glial cells expressing Flt-1 and Flk-1 were reactive astrocytes, although some were microglial cells. The spatiotemporal expression of Flt-1 in the ischemic hippocampus mirrored that of Flk-1 expression. Expression of mRNA for both receptors was induced after 12 h, appeared to be increased progressively until 3 days when the highest expression was reached, and was sustained for more than 2 weeks. Flt-1 and Flk-1 immunoreactivity in the ischemic hippocampus matched the mRNA induction patterns except for a somewhat delayed onset. These data suggest that VEGF may be involved in the glial response via specific VEGF receptors in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Cell death of adult pyramidal CA1 neurons after intraventricular injection of a novel peptide derived from trkA.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Members of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family of neurotrophins bind to the second leucine-rich motif (LRM2) within the extracellular domains of their respective receptors (trkA, trkB, trkC). Small LRM2 peptides have been recently demonstrated to selectively bind the neurotrophins revealing similar complex binding characteristics as full-length receptors. We extend our recent findings, showing that the peptides (A and C) do not block nerve fiber outgrowth through high affinity trk receptors in a ganglia bioassay. Since the highest concentration of neurotrophins [NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3)] is found in the hippocampus, the peptides were injected into the 3rd ventricle of anesthetized adult rats. The (NGF binding) LRM2-A peptide, but not the (BDNF binding) LRM2-B or the (NT-3 binding) LRM2-C peptides, caused severe apoptotic neurodegeneration of hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons as revealed by cresyl violet staining and the TUNEL reaction. The degeneration was protected by intrahippocampal injection of NGF-beta and by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione), indicating a glutamatergic mechanism. In situ hybridization revealed that pyramidal CA1 neurons did not express trkA and p75 receptor mRNA in sham and LRM2-A-lesioned animals. It is concluded that the LRM2-A peptide represents a novel peptide with properties to induce apoptotic cell death of pyramidal CA1 neurons and may be useful as an experimental agent.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previous studies have shown that estrogen application increases the density of synaptic input and the number of spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, we have investigated whether Schaffer collaterals to CA1 pyramidal cells are involved in this estrogen-induced synaptogenesis on CA1 pyramidal neurons. To this end, we studied estrogen-induced expression of both estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes (ERalpha and ERbeta) together with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin in the rat hippocampus. In tissue sections as well as in slice cultures mRNA expression of ERalpha, ERbeta and synaptophysin was higher in CA3 than in CA1, and mRNA expression and immunoreactivity for both ER subtypes were found in both principal cells and interneurons. By using quantitative image analysis we found stronger nuclear immunoreactivity for ERalpha in CA3 than in CA1. In slice cultures, supplementation of the medium with 10(-8) M estradiol led to an increase of nuclear immunoreactivity for ERalpha, but not for ERbeta, which was accompanied by a dramatic up-regulation of synaptophysin immunoreactivity in stratum radiatum of CA1. Together these findings indicate that estrogen effects on hippocampal neurons are more pronounced in CA3 than in CA1 and that ER activation in CA3 neurons leads to an up-regulation of a presynaptic marker protein in the axons of these cells, the Schaffer collaterals. We conclude that estradiol-induced spine formation on CA1 pyramidal cells may be mediated presynaptically, very likely by activation of ERalpha in CA3 pyramidal cells, followed by an increase in Schaffer collateral synapses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human cortical malformations often result in severe forms of epilepsy. Although the morphological properties of cells within these malformations are well characterized, very little is known about the function of these cells. In rats, prenatal methylazoxymethanol (MAM) exposure produces distinct nodules of disorganized pyramidal-like neurons (e.g., nodular heterotopia) and loss of lamination in cortical and hippocampal structures. Hippocampal nodular heterotopias are prone to hyperexcitability and may contribute to the increased seizure susceptibility observed in these animals. Here we demonstrate that heterotopic pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus fail to express a potassium channel subunit corresponding to the fast, transient A-type current. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis revealed markedly reduced expression of Kv4.2 (A-type) channel subunits in heterotopic cell regions of the hippocampus of MAM-exposed rats. Patch-clamp recordings from visualized heterotopic neurons indicated a lack of fast, transient (I(A))-type potassium current and hyperexcitable firing. A-type currents were observed on normotopic pyramidal neurons in MAM-exposed rats and on interneurons, CA1 pyramidal neurons, and cortical layer V-VI pyramidal neurons in saline-treated control rats. Changes in A-current were not associated with an alteration in the function or expression of delayed, rectifier (Kv2.1) potassium channels on heterotopic cells. We conclude that heterotopic neurons lack functional A-type Kv4.2 potassium channels and that this abnormality could contribute to the increased excitability and decreased seizure thresholds associated with brain malformations in MAM-exposed rats.',\n",

Neurol. 399 (1998) 492), we now report the distribution and cellular expression of GLUT4 mRNA in the CNS using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and non-radioactive in situ hybridization (ISH). The former technique demonstrated the expression of GLUT4 in the different regions examined while ISH with a specific riboprobe allowed the anatomical localization of GLUT4 mRNA. A strong hybridization signal was detected in the piriform and entorhinal cortices and in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1-CA3 areas. Numerous moderately labeled cells were additionally observed in the dentate gyrus granular layer, subiculum and most neocortical areas, as well as in different nuclei of the limbic and motor systems. In contrast, positive cell groups were scarce in the hypothalamus. In the hindbrain, a strong expression of GLUT4 mRNA was observed in the large cell bodies of the red nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Moreover, different groups of moderately labeled cells were found in the deep cerebellar and medullary motor nuclei, in various reticular fields and in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The present results of ISH mostly agree with the immunocytochemical data reported by our group, although the immunoreactive cells were generally less numerous. However, the fact that a high expression of GLUT4 mRNA was observed in cell bodies of the piriform lobe, hippocampus and substantia nigra, whereas the immunoreactivity for GLUT4 was low in these regions, suggests the existence of post-transcriptional regulation of GLUT4 expression which may depend on the physiological conditions of the animals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Studies with animal seizure models have indicated that changes in temporal and spatial expression of voltage-gated sodium channels may be important in the pathology of epilepsy. Here, by using in situ hybridisation with previously characterised subtype-selective oligonucleotide probes [Whitaker et al. (2000) J. Comp. Neurol. 422, 123-139], we have compared the cellular expression of all four brain alpha-subunit sodium channel mRNAs in \"normal\" and epileptic hippocampi from humans. Neuronal cell loss was observed in all regions of the hippocampus of diseased patients, indicating that sclerosis had occurred. Losses of up to 40% compared to post-mortem controls were observed which were statistically significant in all regions studied (dentate gyrus, hilus, and CA1-3). To assess mRNA levels of the different alpha-subtypes in specific subregions, control and diseased tissue sections were hybridised to subtype-specific probes. To quantify any changes in expression while allowing for cell loss, the sections were processed for liquid emulsion autoradiography and grain counts were performed on populations of individual neurones in different subregions. No significant differences were found in the expression of type I and VI mRNAs. In contrast, a significant down-regulation of type II mRNA was observed in the epileptic tissue in the remaining pyramidal cells of CA3 (71+/-7% of control, P<0.01), CA2 (81+/-8% of control, P<0.05) and CA1 (72+/-6% of control, P<0.05) compared with control tissue. Additionally, a significant up-regulation in type III mRNA in epileptic CA4 pyramidal cells (145+/-7% of control, P<0.05) was observed. It is not clear whether these changes play a causal role in human epilepsy or whether they are secondary to seizures or drug treatment; further studies are necessary to investigate these alternatives. However, it is likely that such changes would affect the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal neurones.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Rapid decline of GABAA receptor subunit mRNA expression in hippocampus following transient cerebral ischemia in the gerbil.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Inhibitory neurotransmission may play an important role in neuronal degeneration following transient cerebral ischemia. We studied the effect of transient forebrain ischemia on the GABAA receptor system in the gerbil hippocampus. Gerbils were subjected to 5 minutes of bilateral carotid occlusion and were sacrificed at various times over 4 days following reperfusion. There was a substantial loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus 4 days following ischemia. No cell loss was detected in CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, and ventroposterior medial and ventroposterior lateral nuclei of the thalamus at any time following ischemia. Examination of brain slices by in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that a change in expression of the GABAA receptor alpha 1 and beta 2 subunit mRNAs occurred in two phases following onset of reperfusion. The early phase (rapid) occurred within the first 4 hours following reperfusion. The expression of mRNAs significantly decreased (up to 25%) within 1 hour after occlusion in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus and in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The expression of the mRNAs in these regions continued to decrease for 4 hours (up to 43%). In the second phase, which began between 4 and 12 hours following reperfusion, mRNA expression started to return to control levels in CA3 hippocampus and in the dentate. However, expression of both mRNAs continued to decline slowly in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (up to 85%) over the next 3 days, concomitantly with degeneration of the CA1 pyramidal cells. Expression of mRNAs in the ventroposterior medial or ventroposterior lateral nuclei of the thalamus was similar to control values. To determine if a change in GABAA receptor distribution paralleled changes in receptor subunit mRNA expression, we also measured the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to GABAA receptor chloride channels. The t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [35S] binding decreased between 1 and 4 days after reperfusion in the dendritic fields of CA1 pyramidal cells (strata oriens, radiatum, and lacunosum-moleculare) but not in the pyramidal cell body layer. These results indicate that expression of GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs decrease well before CA1 pyramidal cell degeneration and loss of GABAA receptors. At present, it is not clear if an early loss of mRNA expression after an ischemic insult leads to a functional defect in GABAA receptors. If so, a loss of GABA neurotransmission may contribute to the development of neuronal degeneration following cerebral ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide, an undecapeptide originally isolated from the hippocampus of young rats, enhances acetylcholine synthesis in rat medial septal nucleus in vitro. Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide is derived from the N-terminal region of its 21-kmol.wt precursor protein. The highest expression of the hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein messenger RNA is in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In an in vitro rat hippocampal slice, preparation in which electrical stimulation could be delivered to the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapse, semi-quantitative non-radioisotopic in situ hybridization, demonstrated that expression of the hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein messenger RNA is regulated by neuronal activity. Selective inhibition with pharmacological agents revealed that the constitutive hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein messenger RNA level can be up-regulated by D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid, and that activity-dependent transcription can be inhibited by tetrodotoxin, nifedipine, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and scopolamine, but not by mecamylamine. These results indicate that septal cholinergic neurons and hippocampal glutamatergic neurons exert a reciprocal influence over the expression of hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein messenger RNA in the hippocampus, and that the activity-dependent and constitutive expressions of hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein messenger RNA may be regulated by different routes, involving calcium influx via L-type Ca(2+) channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus is hypothesized to support rapid encoding of ongoing experience. A critical prerequisite for such function is the ability to readily recruit enduring synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory consolidation require expression of the immediate-early gene (IEG) Arc. To determine whether Arc transcription could be driven by limited and controlled behavioral experience, we used a rectangular track paradigm. In past electrophysiological studies, pyramidal neurons recorded from rats running in one direction on similar tracks typically exhibited a single firing field. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that the behavioral activity associated with a single lap around the track was sufficient to trigger Arc transcription in complete CA3 neuronal ensembles, as predicted given the role of CA3 in one-trial learning. In contrast, Arc transcription in CA1 ensembles was recruited incrementally, with maximal activation achieved after four laps a day for 4 consecutive days. To test whether Arc transcription is linked to learning and plasticity, or merely elicited by location-specific firing, we inactivated the medial septum, a treatment that compromises hippocampus-dependent learning and LTP but spares location-specific firing in CA1 neurons. Septal inactivation abolished track training-induced Arc transcription in CA1 and CA3 neurons, showing that Arc transcription requires plasticity-inducing stimuli. Accordingly, LTP induction activated Arc transcription in CA1 neurons in vivo. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single brief experience, equivalent to a single crossing of a firing field, can trigger IEG expression required for long-term plasticity in the hippocampus.',\n",

Concurrently, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition is reduced and AMPA receptor-mediated excitation is selectively enhanced in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. In the present study, the effects of chronic FZP exposure on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents were examined in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices and following acute dissociation. In CA1 neurons from chronic FZP-treated rats, evoked NMDAR EPSC amplitude was significantly decreased (52%) in slices, and the maximal current amplitude of NMDA-induced currents in dissociated neurons was also significantly reduced (58%). Evoked NMDAR EPSCs were not altered following acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques, a selective reduction in NR2B subunit mRNA and protein expression was detected in the CA1 and CA2 regions following FZP treatment. However, total hippocampal NMDAR number, as assessed by autoradiography with the NMDAR antagonist, [(3)H]MK-801, was unchanged by FZP treatment. These findings suggest that reduced NMDAR-mediated currents associated with chronic BZ treatment may be related to reduced NR2B subunit-containing NMDARs in the CA1 and CA2 regions. Altered NMDAR function and expression after chronic BZ exposure may contribute to BZ anticonvulsant tolerance or dependence.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We investigated the spatiotemporal expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia using in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Messenger RNA for SOCS-3 was constitutively expressed in neurons of the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers in control animals; however, significant induction was detected in reactive astrocytes preferentially located in the CA1 and the dentate hilar regions of the ischemic hippocampus. SOCS-3 mRNA was induced within 3 days of ischemia and maintained for more than 2 weeks. The in situ hybridization data agreed with the semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. These results demonstrate SOCS-3 induction occurs in reactive astrocytes of the post-ischemic hippocampus, suggesting that SOCS-3 is involved in regulating the astroglial reaction to an ischemic insult.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The extracellular protease cascade of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen has been implicated in neuronal plasticity and degeneration. We show here that unstimulated expression of tPA in the mouse hippocampus is concentrated in the mossy fiber pathway, with little or no expression within the perforant path, the Schaffer collaterals, or neuronal cell bodies. tPA protein is also expressed in vascular endothelial cells throughout the brain parenchyma. Four hours after excitotoxic injury, tPA protein is transiently induced within CA1 pyramidal neurons. The induced CA1 tPA is localized to neurons that survive the injury and is enzymatically active. Within the mossy fiber pathway, injury resulted in decreased tPA protein. In contrast, mossy fiber tPA activity displayed a biphasic character: transient increase at 8 hr, then a decrease by 24 hr after injury. Analysis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression showed that PAI-1 antigen is upregulated by 24 hr and could account for the tPA activity downregulation seen at this time point. Plasminogen immunohistochemistry suggested an increase within the mossy fiber pathway after injury. Finally, hippocampal tPA expression among various mammalian species was strikingly different. These results indicate a complex control of tPA protein and enzymatic activity in the hippocampus that may help regulate neuronal plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Triheptanoin protects against status epilepticus-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Triheptanoin, the triglyceride of heptanoate, is anaplerotic (refills deficient tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates) via the propionyl-CoA carboxylase pathway. It has been shown to be neuroprotective and anticonvulsant in several models of neurological disorders. Here, we investigated the effects of triheptanoin against changes of hippocampal mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress and cell death induced by pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in mice. Ten days of triheptanoin pre-treatment did not protect against SE, but it preserved hippocampal mitochondrial functions including state 2, state 3 ADP, state 3 uncoupled respiration, respiration linked to ATP synthesis along with the activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex 24\\xa0h post-SE. Triheptanoin prevented the SE-induced reductions of hippocampal mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity and plasma antioxidant status as well as lipid peroxidation. It also reduced neuronal degeneration in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions 3\\xa0days after SE. In addition, heptanoate significantly reduced hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in cultured neurons. In situ hybridization localized the enzymes of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase pathway, specifically Pccα, Pccβ and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to adult mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells, indicating that anaplerosis may occur in neurons. In conclusion, triheptanoin appears to have anaplerotic and antioxidant effects which contribute to its neuroprotective properties.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In this study, we performed in situ hybridization analysis of the expression pattern of two growth-associated proteins, stathmin and SCG10, in the hippocampus after unilateral lesion of the perforant pathway, the main excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. Stathmin is one of the major neural-enriched cytosolic phosphoproteins and a potential target of cyclic-AMP-dependent kinases [Jin L. W. et al. (1996) Neurobiol. Aging 17, 331-341; Leighton I. A. et al. (1993) Molec. Cell Biochem. 127/128, 151-156]. Three days after the lesion, stathmin messenger RNA was up-regulated ipsilaterally in the hilus, in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region. Simultaneously, the hilar region of the contralateral dentate gyrus showed an increased stathmin messenger RNA expression. This altered expression pattern was observed until 15 days after lesion. Stathmin messenger RNA expression returned to a normal level until 21 days after lesion in all regions analysed. SCG10, a membrane-bound neuronal growth-associated protein belonging to the SCG10/stathmin gene family, did not show any alteration of messenger RNA expression after perforant path lesion. The temporal changes of stathmin messenger RNA expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus correspond well to the process of reactive synaptogenesis. The enhanced messenger RNA expression in the hilar region of the contralateral dentate gyrus might suggest a role in neurite elongation, since this region is the origin of commissural fibres involved in the sprouting response in the deafferented hippocampus. The present study provides evidence that the induction of specific growth-associated proteins is differentially regulated in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus in adult rats leads to delayed, selective death of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3. Death is preceded by down-regulation of glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) mRNA and protein [the subunit that limits Ca(2+) permeability of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors] in CA1 and CA3, as indicated by in situ hybridization, immunolabeling, and quantitative Western blotting. GluR1 mRNA and protein are unchanged or slightly increased before cell death. These changes could lead to formation of GluR2-lacking, Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and increased toxicity of endogenous glutamate. GluR2 immunolabeling is unchanged in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, which are resistant to seizure-induced death. Thus, formation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors may be a critical mediator of delayed neurodegeneration after status epilepticus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in long-term potentiation (LTP) in pyramidal neurons in cellular area 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus. However, considerable confusion exists about the exact role of NO, and the contribution of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) isoforms of NO synthase to NO-dependent LTP (NO-LTP), with results often varying, depending on the organism and experimental paradigm used. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we contrast NO synthase expression and activity in rat, mouse, and human hippocampus. nNOS is prominently expressed in all CA1 pyramidal cells of C57B6 mice and humans, while in rats and SV129 mice, its levels are much lower and restricted to the caudal hippocampus. By contrast, eNOS is restricted to endothelial cells. We observe N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent citrulline production in pyramidal cells of mouse hippocampus, which is absent in nNOS(Delta/Delta) animals. Finally, we observe robust nNOS expression in human CA1 pyramidal cells.The considerable axial, developmental, strain and species-dependent variations in nNOS expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons can explain much of the variation observed in reports of NO-dependent LTP. Moreover, our data suggest that NO produced by eNOS in endothelial cells may play a paracrine role in modulating LTP.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most significant infectious cause of developmental brain disorders in humans. The infection occasionally persists and causes neurological disorders. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors is essential for the development and plasticity of synapses, but also is involved in neuronal excitotoxicity during viral infection. Here we investigated the effects of murine CMV (MCMV) infection on the expression of NMDA receptors in the hippocampal neurons of neonatal mice and primary neuronal cultures. Viral antigen was mostly found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from the CA1 to CA3. Image analysis of immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NMDA-R1) protein in CA1 neurons of MCMV-infected brain was reduced to 40% of that in uninfected brain. The signal of in situ hybridization for NMDA-R1 mRNA was also decreased in CA1 neurons of MCMV-infected brain. In primary neuronal cultures, reduction of NMDA-R1 expression in MCMV-infected neurons was also detected by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. These results suggest that reduction of NMDA receptor expression by MCMV infection may cause a decrease in the susceptibility of the neurons to excitotoxic cell death, and may be related to the establishment of viral persistence and functional disturbances in MCMV-infected neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the present study, serotonin (5-HT) responses of hippocampal pyramidal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) neurons were studied in rats subjected twice daily for 21 days to unpredictable stressors. In hippocampal tissue from thus stressed rats mRNA expression of the 5-HT(1A) receptor and mineralo- as well as glucocorticoid receptors were examined with in situ hybridization. On average, stressed rats displayed increased adrenal weight and attenuated body weight gain compared with controls, supporting that the animals had experienced increased corticosterone levels due to the stress exposure. One day after the last stressor, under conditions that corticosterone levels were low (predominant mineralocorticoid receptor activation), the 5-HT(1A) receptor mediated hyperpolarization of CA1 neurons in response to 10 microM 5-HT was significantly reduced compared with controls. Basal membrane properties of CA1 cells in stressed rats were comparable to those of controls. The 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA expression was not changed after chronic stress exposure, in any of the hippocampal areas. A small but significant increase in mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression was observed after stress in the dentate gyrus, while glucocorticoid receptor expression was unchanged. The data indicate that unpredictable stress exposure for 3 weeks results in suppression of 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated responses, possibly due to posttranslational modification of the receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'As a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), neurogranin (NG) is involved in the regulation of calcium signaling and activity-dependent plasticity. Recently, we have shown that, in the rodent cerebellum, NG is exclusively expressed by gamma-aminobutyric acidergic Golgi cells, whereas, in the monkey cerebellum, brush cells were the only neuronal population expressing NG (Singec et al. [2003] J. Comp. Neurol. 459:278-289). In the present study, we analyzed the neocortical and hippocampal expression patterns of NG in adult mouse (C57Bl/6), rat (Wistar), and monkey (Cercopithecus aetiops). By using immunocytochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization, we demonstrate strong NG expression by principal cells in different neocortical layers and in the hippocampus by granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurons of CA1-CA3. In contrast, double-labeling experiments in rodents revealed that neocortical and hippocampal interneurons expressing glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) were consistently devoid of NG. In addition, by using antibodies against parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin, we could demonstrate the absence of NG in interneurons of monkey frontal cortex and hippocampus. Together these findings corroborate the idea of different calcium signaling pathways in excitatory and inhibitory cells that may contribute to different modes of synaptic plasticity in these neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2) modulate neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling in the hippocampus during the rat estrous cycle and in response to deafferenting lesions, but little is known about the steroidal regulation of hippocampal progesterone receptors associated with these processes. We examined the neuronal expression of progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (Pgrmc1) and the classical progesterone receptor (Pgr), by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Pgr, a transcription factor, has been associated with synaptic remodeling and other major actions of P4, whereas Pgrmc1 is implicated in P4-dependent proliferation of adult neuroprogenitor cells and with rapid P4 effects on membranes. Ovariectomized adult rats were given E2, P4, or E2+P4 on two schedules: a 4-d model of the rodent estrous cycle and a 30-d model of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Pgr was hormonally responsive only in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and the induction of Pgr by E2 was partly antagonized by P4 only on the 30-d schedule. In CA3 pyramidal and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons, Pgr was largely unresponsive to all hormone treatments. In contrast to Pgr, Pgrmc1 was generally induced by E2 and/or P4 throughout the hippocampus in CA1, CA3, and DG neurons. In neuroprogenitor cells of the DG (immunopositive for bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin), both Pgrmc1 and Pgr were detected. The differential regulation of hippocampal Pgrmc1 and Pgr by E2 and P4 may guide drug development in hormonal therapy for support of neurogenesis and synaptic regeneration.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Role of the GLT-1 subtype of glutamate transporter in glutamate homeostasis: the GLT-1-preferring inhibitor WAY-855 produces marginal neurotoxicity in the rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is tightly regulated by cell surface transporters to avoid increases in concentration and associated neurotoxicity. Selective blockers of glutamate transporter subtypes are sparse and so knock-out animals and antisense techniques have been used to study their specific roles. Here we used WAY-855, a GLT-1-preferring blocker, to assess the role of GLT-1 in rat hippocampus. GLT-1 was the most abundant transporter in the hippocampus at the mRNA level. According to [(3)H]-l-glutamate uptake data, GLT-1 was responsible for approximately 80% of the GLAST-, GLT-1-, and EAAC1-mediated uptake that occurs within dissociated hippocampal tissue, yet when this transporter was preferentially blocked for 120 h with WAY-855 (100 microm), no significant neurotoxicity was observed in hippocampal slices. This is in stark contrast to results obtained with TBOA, a broad-spectrum transport blocker, which, at concentrations that caused a similar inhibition of glutamate uptake (10 and 30 microm), caused substantial neuronal death when exposed to the slices for 24 h or longer. Likewise, WAY-855, did not significantly exacerbate neurotoxicity associated with simulated ischemia, whereas TBOA did. Finally, intrahippocampal microinjection of WAY-855 (200 and 300 nmol) in vivo resulted in marginal damage compared with TBOA (20 and 200 nmol), which killed the majority of both CA1-4 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells. These results indicate that selective inhibition of GLT-1 is insufficient to provoke glutamate build-up, leading to NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxic effects, and suggest a prominent role of GLAST and/or EAAC1 in extracellular glutamate maintenance.',\n",

In situ hybridization, double-labeled immunofluorescence stain and double-labeled immunohistochemistry stain in adjacent sections were used in our research to study the distribution, co-localization of FSH and its receptor and co-localization of FSH and GnRH receptor in rat hippocampus. The result found that pyramidal neurons from CA1 to CA4 region and granule neurons in dentate gyrus could express FSH and its receptor, majority of hippocampal neurons co-expressed FSH and its receptor, FSH and GnRH receptor. These suggested that hippocampal neurons not only express FSH but also act as FSH target cells. FSH may regulate the function of hippocampal neurons by ways of paracrine or autocrine. At the same time, GnRH may regulate the function of FSH neuron in hippocampus through GnRH receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies indicate that bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) and Noggin not only play an important role in the early development of the nervous system, but may also play a role in postnatal central nervous system (CNS) development. In this study, we examined the relative levels and localization of Noggin and BMP4 mRNA in the hippocampus of rats of different developmental stages with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). RT-PCR showed that the temporal changes in the levels of expression of Noggin and BMP4 were different. The peak level of expression of Noggin mRNA was observed at embryonic day 13 (E13), subsequently gradually declined at 1-3 months (P1-3M) postnatal, and was detected only at a low level at P18M. In contrast, the expression of BMP4 mRNA increased gradually during embryonic development, reached a maximal level at 3 weeks (W) postnatal, and declined only slightly through P18M. In situ hybridization revealed that at embryonic stages, Noggin mRNA was localized throughout all hippocampal regions, whereas at early postnatal ages, Noggin mRNA was primarily localized in the anterior subiculum. At embryonic and early postnatal stages, no significant BMP4 mRNA expression was detectable in the hippocampus. At later postnatal ages, however, Noggin and BMP4 mRNA expression was observed in similar patterns. At 1-3 months postnatal, expression of BMP4 was observed mainly in the dentate gyrus and in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layers. Lower hybridization signals were observed in the hilus and subiculum. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Noggin and BMP4 are expressed in embryonic and postnatal hippocampus, and that the temporal and spatial patterns of their expression are developmentally regulated. These data suggest that Noggin and BMP4 play important roles in hippocampal development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To investigate the molecular changes underlying kindling epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus, the expression levels of the genes encoding for 13 different gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor (GABAAR) subunits were measured in hippocampal principal neurons using in situ hybridization techniques and semi-quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms. Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway kindled rats were investigated at three different stages of kindling acquisition, at 24 h after the last seizure and at long-term (28 days) after termination of kindling stimulations. Changes were distinct for the different subunits in the three analyzed regions (CA1, CA3, fascia dentata) and also different for the various kindling stages. In all hippocampal areas at the early phases of kindling epileptogenesis, before the appearance of generalized seizures, an increase was found of those transcripts that constituted the majority of the expressed variants in control animals (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2/gamma 2L mRNA). In these stages, the increased levels of different variants in the granular neurons of the fascia dentata were more pronounced when compared to the pattern of changes in pyramidal cells of CA1 and CA3. In fully kindled animals, the expression levels of several subunits returned to control levels, whereas beta 3 and gamma 2/gamma 2L mRNA expression was still significantly enhanced in all areas. At long-term, few changes were encountered. The long-splice variant of gamma 2 was decreased within pyramidal and granular neurons while the total level of gamma 2 mRNA was not different from controls. The increased GABAAR subunit expression in the fascia dentata may underly the reported increased GABAAR ligand binding and the increased GABA mediated inhibition. However, the decreased GABAAR binding and the attenuation of GABAergic inhibition in CA1, could not be explained by a decrement of receptor subunit expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Our previous study showed that 3-min cerebral ischemic preconditioning (CIP) up-regulated the expression of glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) protein, which protects pyramidal neurons, allowing them to survive an 8-min ischemic insult that usually induces severe delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. In the present study, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to observe whether GLT-1 mRNA is modulated and whether actrocytes and/or neurons express GLT-1 mRNA during the induction of brain ischemic tolerance. We observed that GLT-1 mRNA is expressed in neurons and astrocytes in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. The expression of GLT-1 mRNA was significantly down-regulated in both neurons and astrocytes after the 8-min lethal ischemic insult. CIP for 3 min increased the expression of GLT-1 mRNA in neurons and astrocytes, and induced the elongation of the astrocytic processes around pyramidal neurons. It may be concluded that CIP performed 2 days before lethal ischemic insult activated astrocytes, which resulted in an increased number of lengthened processes expressing high levels of GLT-1, which protected the neurons and allowed them to survive 8-min ischemic insult that is usually lethal to neurons in the hippocampal CA1 subfield.

       "  'Abstract': \"We generated transgenic (Thy1alpha6) mice in which the GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit, whose expression is usually confined to granule cells of cerebellum and cochlear nuclei, is ectopically expressed under the control of the pan-neuronal Thy-1.2 promoter. Strong Thy1alpha6 subunit expression occurs, for example, in deep cerebellar nuclei, layer V iscocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. Ligand binding and protein biochemistry show that most forebrain alpha6 subunits assemble as alpha6betagamma2-type receptors, and some as alpha1alpha6betagamma2 and alpha3alpha6betagamma2 receptors. Electron microscopic immunogold labeling shows that most Thy1-derived alpha6 immunoreactivity is in the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendrites and spines in both layer V isocortical and CA1pyramidal cells. Synaptic immunolabeling is rare. Consistent with the alpha6 subunits' extrasynaptic localization, Thy1alpha6 CA1 pyramidal neurons have a five-fold increased tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated current compared with wild-type cells; however, the spontaneous IPSC frequency and the mIPSC amplitude in Thy1alpha6 mice decrease 37 and 30%, respectively compared with wild-type. Our results strengthen the idea that GABA(A) receptors containing alpha6 subunits can function as extrasynaptic receptors responsible for tonic inhibition and further suggest that a homeostatic mechanism might operate, whereby increased tonic inhibition causes a compensatory decrease in synaptic GABA(A) receptor responses.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We studied the distribution of the ubiquitin-specific protease Usp9x in mouse brain as it relates to the potential role of ubiquitin proteasome system in synaptic plasticity. Usp9x is the mouse homolog of faf, known for its function in synaptic development in Drosophila. In adults, high levels of expression of Usp9x protein were found in layer V of neocortex, Purkinje cells in cerebellum, and specific hippocampal subfields. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, Usp9x expression was higher in CA3 than in CA1. This regional specificity was detected at postnatal day 22 but not at postnatal day 15. In adult mice, the CA1-CA3 difference was partially accounted for by a difference in the level of Usp9x mRNA, suggesting that transcription of Usp9x was differentially regulated between hippocampal subfields. Two synaptic marker proteins, synaptotagmin and spinophilin, were both more abundant in the striatum oriens of CA3 than in the similar region of CA1, correlating with the distribution of Usp9x, a result compatible with a role for Usp9x in synaptic development in mouse hippocampus. Ube1x, the enzyme responsible for the initial step in ubiquitin conjugation, was preferentially concentrated in the dendrites of the CA1 neurons instead of the CA3 neurons, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between ubiquitin conjugation and deubiquitination in CA3 and CA1. This spatial and temporal specificity in expression of Usp9x and Ube1x protein raises interesting questions about the roles of these ubiquitin enzymes in the differential functions of CA1 and CA3.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), isolated for the first time from bovine and human parathyroid, is a G-protein-coupled receptors that has been involved in diverse physiological functions. At present a complete in vivo work on the identification of CaSR mRNA-expressing cells in the adult brain lacks and this investigation was undertaken in order to acquire more information on cell type expressing CaSR mRNA in the rat brain and to analyse for the first time its expression in different experimental models of brain injury. The expression of CaSR mRNAs was found mainly in scattered cells throughout almost all the brain regions. A double labeling analysis showed a colocalization of CaSR mRNA expression in neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas it was not found expressed both in the microglia and in astrocytes. One week after kainate-induced seizure CaSR was found in the injured CA3 region of the hippocampus and very interestingly it was found up-regulated in the neurons of CA1-CA2 and dentate gyrus. Similarly, 1 week following ibotenic acid injection in the hippocampus, CaSR mRNA expression was increased in oligodendrocytes both in the lesioned area and in the contralateral CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layers and dentate gyrus. One week after needle-induced mechanical lesion an increase of labeled cells expressing CaSR mRNA was observed along the needle track. In conclusion, the present results contribute to extend available data on cell type-expressing CaSR in normal and injured brain and could spur to understand the role of CaSR in repairing processes of brain injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Several lines of evidence have pointed to a role of the dopamine system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A recent postmortem study demonstrated a selective decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase fibers on pyramidal neurons in sector CA2 in the hippocampus of schizophrenics. Although both brain imaging and postmortem studies have examined the distribution of the D1 receptor in the prefrontal and cingulate cortex, no study to date has examined its expression of mRNA using a high-resolution autoradiographic approach. In order to further assess whether the regulation of the dopamine D1 receptor is altered in hippocampal neurons in this disorder, we used in situ hybridization (ISH) to measure the expression of messenger RNA for this receptor in the dentate gyrus and sectors CA1-4. Both the number of cells expressing D1 mRNA and the amount of expression per cell were measured in 15 schizophrenic, 15 bipolar disorder, and 15 normal control subjects. The results show a significant (21%) and selective decrease in D1 mRNA expression in sector CA3 of schizophrenic subjects. First-degree relatives of schizophrenics did not show any differences in either the expression of D1 mRNA per cell or the number of cells expressing this mRNA when compared to a separate group of normal controls matched for age and PMI. Subjects with bipolar disorder also showed a significant (25%) and selective increase of D1 mRNA expression in sector CA2. Other hippocampal sectors did not show significant changes. These findings in schizophrenics and bipolars were also associated with inverse changes in the overall number of neurons expressing D1 mRNA in sectors CA3 and CA2, respectively. This study shows diagnosis-specific changes in D1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of schizophrenic versus bipolar subjects and suggests that this neuromodulatory system may show distinct changes in the pathophysiology of the two disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Metabotropic GABA(B) receptors mediate slow inhibitory effects presynaptically and postsynaptically. Using preembedding immunohistochemical methods combined with quantitative analysis of GABA(B) receptor subunit immunoreactivity, this study provides a detailed description of the cellular and subcellular localization of GABA(B1a/b) and GABA(B2) in the rat hippocampus. At the light microscopic level, an overlapping distribution of GABA(B1a/b) and GABA(B2) was revealed in the dendritic layers of the hippocampus. In addition, expression of the GABA(B1a/b) subunit was found in somata of CA1 pyramidal cells and of a subset of GABAergic interneurons. At the electron microscopic level, immunoreactivity for both subunits was observed on presynaptic and, more abundantly, on postsynaptic elements. Presynaptically, subunits were mainly detected in the extrasynaptic membrane and occasionally over the presynaptic membrane specialization of putative glutamatergic and, to a lesser extent, GABAergic axon terminals. Postsynaptically, the majority of GABA(B) receptor subunits were localized to the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of spines and dendritic shafts of principal cells and shafts of interneuron dendrites. Quantitative analysis revealed enrichment of GABA(B1a/b) around putative glutamatergic synapses on spines and an even distribution on dendritic shafts of pyramidal cells contacted by GABAergic boutons. The association of GABA(B) receptors with glutamatergic synapses at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sides indicates their intimate involvement in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The dominant extrasynaptic localization of GABA(B) receptor subunits suggests that their activation is dependent on spillover of GABA requiring simultaneous activity of populations of GABAergic cells as it occurs during population oscillations or epileptic seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The morphology of neurons in the main divisions of the hippocampal complex allow the easy identification of granule cells in the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions of Ammon's horn. However, neurons in the CA2 subfield have been much more difficult to reliably identify. We have recently identified a set of genes whose expression is restricted to either the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, or CA3. Here we show that these genes have an essentially nonoverlapping distribution throughout the entire septotemporal extent of the hippocampus. 3-Dimensional reconstruction of serial sections processed for in situ hybridization of mannosidase 1, alpha (CA1), bcl-2-related ovarian killer protein (CA3), and Purkinje cell protein 4 (dentate gyrus+CA2) was used to define the boundaries of each subregion throughout the entire hippocampus. The boundaries observed for these three genes are recapitulated across a much larger set of genes similarly enriched in specific hippocampal subregions. The extent of CA2 defined on the basis of gene expression is somewhat larger than that previously described on the basis of structural anatomical criteria, particularly at the rostral pole of the hippocampus. These results indicate that, at least at the molecular level, there are robust, consistent genetic boundaries between hippocampal subregions CA1, CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus, allowing a redefinition of their boundaries in order to facilitate functional studies of different neuronal subtypes in the hippocampus.\",\n",

Complementary experimental approaches were used to investigate alterations in the learning and memory processes of our transgenic model. The ability of the knockout strain to carry out the inhibitory passive avoidance test was found to be considerably impaired although no significant differences were observed in anxiety levels. This impaired cognitive property prompted us to explore modifications in N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) responses in the hippocampus. Intracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from the MCHR1(Neo/Neo) mice revealed significantly decreased NMDA responses. Finally, using in situ hybridization we found a 15% reduction in NMDAR1 subunit in the CA1 region.

It is well established that immediate-early genes are rapidly and transiently induced in response to neuronal activity and this expression is required for stabilization of durable memories. To examine whether age-related memory impairment might be caused, in part, by differences in the level of cellular activation or subcellular processing, c-fos expression in CA1 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells in the dorsal hippocampus of young and old rats was determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. No significant age differences were found in the numbers of pyramidal or granule cells that show c-fos expression; however, c-fos mRNA transcripts were altered in these 2 cell types in aged animals. These findings suggest that though the networks of cells that participate in behavior or seizure-induced activity are largely maintained in aged rats, their RNA transcript levels are altered. This might, in part, contribute to cognitive deficits frequently observed with advancing age.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential effects of corticosterone on the slow afterhyperpolarization in the basolateral amygdala and CA1 region: possible role of calcium channel subunits.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The stress hormone corticosterone increases the amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons, without affecting resting membrane potential, input resistance, or action potential characteristics. We here examined how corticosterone affects these properties in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In the amygdala, corticosterone does not change the AHP amplitude, nor any of the passive and active membrane properties studied. The lack of effect on the AHP is surprising since in both areas corticosterone increases high-voltage-activated sustained calcium currents, which supposedly regulate the sAHP. We wondered whether corticosterone targets different calcium channel subunits in the two areas because currents through only one of the subunits (Cav1.3) are thought to alter the AHP amplitude. In situ hybridization studies revealed that CA1 cells express Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 subunits; corticosterone does not transcriptionally regulate Cav1.2 but increases Cav1.3 expression compared with vehicle treatment. In the BLA, Cav1.3 expression was not detectable, both after control and corticosterone treatment. Cav1.2 is moderately expressed. In a modeling study, we examined putative consequences of changes in specific calcium channel subunit expression and calcium extrusion by corticosterone for the AHP in CA1 and amygdala neurons. A differential distribution and transcriptional regulation of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 in the CA1 area versus BLA partly explain the observed differences in AHP amplitude. The functional implication of these findings could be that stress-induced arousal of activity in the BLA is more prolonged than that in the CA1 hippocampal area, so that information with an emotional component is more effectively encoded.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effects of acetylcholine on both pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the area CA1 of the rat hippocampus were examined, using intracellular recording techniques in an in vitro slice preparation. In current-clamp mode, fast local application of acetylcholine (ACh) to the soma of inhibitory interneurons in stratum radiatum resulted in depolarization and rapid firing of action potentials. Under voltage-clamp, ACh produced fast, rapidly desensitizing inward currents that were insensitive to atropine but that were blocked by nanomolar concentrations of the nicotinic alpha7 receptor-selective antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin (alphaBgTx) and methyllycaconitine. Nicotinic receptor antagonists that are not selective for alpha7-containing receptors had little (mecamylamine) or no effect (dihydro-beta-erythroidine) on the ACh-induced currents. Glutamate receptor antagonists had no effect on the ACh-evoked response, indicating that the current was not mediated by presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release. However, the current could be desensitized almost completely by bath superfusion with 100 nM nicotine. In contrast to those actions on interneurons, application of ACh to the soma of CA1 pyramidal cells did not produce a detectable current. Radioligand-binding experiments with [125I]-alphaBgTx demonstrated that stratum radiatum interneurons express alpha7-containing nAChRs, and in situ hybridization revealed significant amounts of alpha7 mRNA. CA1 pyramidal cells did not show specific binding of [125I]-alphaBgTx and only low levels of alpha7 mRNA. These results suggest that, in addition to their proposed presynaptic role in modulating transmitter release, alpha7-containing nAChRs also may play a postsynaptic role in the excitation of hippocampal interneurons. By desensitizing these receptors, nicotine may disrupt this action and indirectly excite pyramidal neurons by reducing GABAergic inhibition.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Steroidogenic factor-1 expression in marmoset and rat hippocampus: co-localization with StAR and aromatase.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), an orphan nuclear receptor, was studied with respect to the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the hippocampus of rat and marmoset, since SF-1 is a regulator of steroid biosynthesis in the gonads. We used the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) as a marker of the first step in the cascade of oestrogen synthesis and aromatase as a marker of the last. StAR transports cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is converted by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme complex. This is the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. Aromatase metabolizes testosterone to oestrogen. Using an anti-SF-1 antibody we show that SF-1 is highly expressed in neuronal cells of the pyramidal layer (CA1--CA3) and in the dentate gyrus of rat and marmoset hippocampi. Binding of the antibody was seen in more than 60% of all cells in the pyramidal layer and in the fascia dentata. In situ hybridization studies revealed the same expression pattern for StAR and aromatase. StAR and aromatase-positive cells were strictly correlated with SF-1 as shown by computer-assisted confocal microscopy in double labelling experiments (immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization). This coexpression may imply SF-1 as a possible regulator of steroidogenesis in the hippocampus. However, a few interneurones express solely SF-1 and aromatase but are negative for StAR. Since the expression of StAR represents the first step in steroidogenesis its expression is suggestive for a de novo synthesis of steroids. A small population of interneurones must import precursors for oestrogen synthesis from other sources. Responsive cells, as evidenced by the presence of oestrogen receptor transcripts, were also found in the pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus. In conclusion, (1) SF-1 could play a regulatory role in steroidogenesis in the hippocampus of marmoset and rat and (2) with respect to the capacity of steroidogenesis two populations of hippocampal neurones coexist.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. The expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was examined in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with transient global ischemia in order to study the involvement of the infiltration of blood monocytes in the mechanism of ischemia-related neuronal death. 2. The brains of the animals with occlusion of the bilateral carotid arteries for 10 min were removed at 8 h, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after reperfusion. Frozen sections were used for in situ hybridization and tissue specimens from the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex were used to measure the concentration of MCP-1 by ELISA. 3. No MCP-1 mRNA was detected in the hippocampus of the sham group animals. One day after ischemia-reperfusion, MCP-1 mRNA was clearly expressed in the CA4 subfield and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, while it was slightly expressed in the lacnosum moleculare of the CA1 subfield. A dramatic expression was demonstrated in the entire CA1 subfield at 2 days after the operation. Most of the cells expressing MCP-1 were astrocytes. At 4 and 7 days after reperfusion, no MCP-1 mRNA was detected in the hippocampus. The concentration of MCP-1 protein dramatically increased in the hippocampus at 2 days after reperfusion. 4. Taken together with the findings of our previous study showing an increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in the hippocampus from 12 h after ischemia-reperfusion, the astrocytes expressing MCP-1 might therefore induce the migration of monocytes into the brain parenchyma. As a result, such astrocytes expressing MCP-1 may therefore be related to the pathological events of delayed neuronal death in the pyramidal neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Lipoprotein and endothelial lipases are members of the triglyceride lipase gene family. These genes are expressed in the brain, where the encoded proteins are fulfilling functions that have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we examined the distribution of their respective mRNAs in the C57BL/6 mouse brain by in situ hybridization. In control mice, we observed widespread expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA mainly in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (CA1, CA2 and CA3 areas), in the striatum and in several cortical areas. Endothelial lipase (EL) mRNA expression was restricted to CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, to ependymal cells in the ventral part of the third ventricle and to some cortical cell layers. To gain insight into the role played by lipases in the brain, neurodegeneration was induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA) or by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Upon injection of KA, a rapid increase in EL mRNA expression was observed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and neocortex. However, the levels of LPL mRNA were unaffected by KA injection. Remarkably, after focal cerebral ischemia, the expression of EL was unaffected whereas a dramatic increase in LPL expression was observed in neocortical areas of the lesioned side of the brain. These results show that LPL and EL transcripts are selectively upregulated in function of the type of brain injury. LPL and EL could thus fulfill a function in the pathophysiological response of the brain to injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synaptopodin is an actin-binding protein of renal podocytes and dendritic spines. We have recently shown that synaptopodin is localized to the spine apparatus, a characteristic organelle of dendritic spines on forebrain neurons. Synaptopodin-deficient mice do not form spine apparatuses, indicating a role of synaptopodin in the formation of this organelle. Here we studied the development of synaptopodin expression in the postnatal rat hippocampus. At birth, synaptopodin mRNA is mainly expressed in CA3 pyramidal neurons. At postnatal day (P) 6, synaptopodin mRNA expression is still strongest in CA3 but is now also found in CA1 pyramidal neurons and granule cells of the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus. At P9, an almost adult pattern is seen with synaptopodin mRNA expressed by virtually all principal neurons. While synaptopodin mRNA was restricted to cell somata, immunostaining for synaptopodin protein labeled dendritic layers. At birth, no immunoreactivity was visible, while at P5 a weak staining mainly in stratum oriens was observed. At P9, immunolabeling was still strongest in stratum oriens followed by the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The adult pattern with strong labeling of all dendritic layers was reached by P12. Together these findings show that synaptopodin expression follows the well-known sequence of hippocampal principal neuron development. Unexpectedly, we also observed synaptopodin mRNA expression in a small population of interneurons as revealed by double labeling with interneuron markers. However, no immunolabeling for synaptopodin was observed in identified interneurons, confirming that the protein is mainly present in spine-bearing principal cells.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Parvalbumin interneurons and calretinin fibers arising from the thalamic nucleus reuniens degenerate in the subiculum after kainic acid-induced seizures.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The subiculum is the major output area of the hippocampus. It is closely interconnected with the entorhinal cortex and other parahippocampal areas. In animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in TLE patients it exerts increased network excitability and may crucially contribute to the propagation of limbic seizures. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ-hybridization we now investigated neuropathological changes affecting parvalbumin and calretinin containing neurons in the subiculum and other parahippocampal areas after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. We observed prominent losses in parvalbumin containing interneurons in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex, and in the principal cell layers of the pre- and parasubiculum. Degeneration of parvalbumin-positive neurons was associated with significant precipitation of parvalbumin-immunoreactive debris 24 h after kainic acid injection. In the subiculum the superficial portion of the pyramidal cell layer was more severely affected than its deep part. In the entorhinal cortex, the deep layers were more severely affected than the superficial ones. The decrease in number of parvalbumin-positive neurons in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex correlated with the number of spontaneous seizures subsequently experienced by the rats. The loss of parvalbumin neurons thus may contribute to the development of spontaneous seizures. On the other hand, surviving parvalbumin neurons revealed markedly increased expression of parvalbumin mRNA notably in the pyramidal cell layer of the subiculum and in all layers of the entorhinal cortex. This indicates increased activity of these neurons aiming to compensate for the partial loss of this functionally important neuron population. Furthermore, calretinin-positive fibers terminating in the molecular layer of the subiculum, in sector CA1 of the hippocampus proper and in the entorhinal cortex degenerated together with their presumed perikarya in the thalamic nucleus reuniens. In addition, a significant loss of calretinin containing interneurons was observed in the subiculum. Notably, the loss in parvalbumin positive neurons in the subiculum equaled that in human TLE. It may result in marked impairment of feed-forward inhibition of the temporo-ammonic pathway and may significantly contribute to epileptogenesis. Similarly, the loss of calretinin-positive fiber tracts originating from the nucleus reuniens thalami significantly contributes to the rearrangement of neuronal circuitries in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex during epileptogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8-expressing nerve terminals target subsets of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) show a highly selective expression and subcellular location in nerve terminals modulating neurotransmitter release. We have demonstrated that alternatively spliced variants of mGluR8, mGluR8a and mGluR8b, have an overlapping distribution in the hippocampus, and besides perforant path terminals, they are expressed in the presynaptic active zone of boutons making synapses selectively with several types of GABAergic interneurons, primarily in the stratum oriens. Boutons labeled for mGluR8 formed either type I or type II synapses, and the latter were GABAergic. Some mGluR8-positive boutons also expressed mGluR7 or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Interneurons strongly immunopositive for the muscarinic M2 or the mGlu1 receptors were the primary targets of mGluR8-containing terminals in the stratum oriens, but only neurochemically distinct subsets were innervated by mGluR8-enriched terminals. The majority of M2-positive neurons were mGluR8 innervated, but a minority, which expresses somatostatin, was not. Rare neurons coexpressing calretinin and M2 were consistently targeted by mGluR8-positive boutons. In vivo recording and labeling of an mGluR8-decorated and strongly M2-positive interneuron revealed a trilaminar cell with complex spike bursts during theta oscillations and strong discharge during sharp wave/ripple events. The trilaminar cell had a large projection from the CA1 area to the subiculum and a preferential innervation of interneurons in the CA1 area in addition to pyramidal cell somata and dendrites. The postsynaptic interneuron type-specific expression of the high-efficacy presynaptic mGluR8 in both putative glutamatergic and in identified GABAergic terminals predicts a role in adjusting the activity of interneurons depending on the level of network activity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Retention of NMDA receptor NR2 subunits in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum in targeted NR1 knockout mice.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate-selective glutamate receptor (NR) consisting of the NR1 subunit and an NR2 or NR3 subunit plays crucial roles in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and learning and memory. By using a knockout mouse strain, in which the NR1 gene deletion is primarily targeted to the CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, we investigated the in vivo effect of the loss of the NR1 subunit on the cellular expression and intracellular distribution of the NR2 subunits. The NR1 gene deletion had no apparent effect on the levels of NR2A or NR2B mRNA but led to severe reductions of NR2A and NR2B protein in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. This reduced dendritic distribution of the NR2 subunits accompanied their robust accumulation in perikarya, where they were condensed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum as electron-dense granules. These granules were also observed in CA1 pyramidal cells of the control mice but they were much fewer and contained no detectable levels of the NR2 subunit. The effect of the NR1 knockout on intracellular localization of the NR2 subunits was specific in that no such effect was observed for the GluR1 and PSD-95, two other major postsynaptic proteins. These results suggest that the NR1 subunit plays a crucial role in the release of the NR2 subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum in hippocampal pyramidal cells in vivo, and when the NR1 subunit is unavailable, the NR2 subunits are retained and aggregate into intracisternal granules.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) mRNA and protein in the adult human brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) plays important roles in the development and plasticity of the brain, and it has recently been identified as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Though there are rodent data, little is known about its distribution in the human brain. The aim of this study was to ascertain the localization of NRG-1 and its mRNA in multiple regions of the normal adult human brain. We investigated NRG-1 mRNA in 11 subjects using in situ hybridization and northern analysis, and NRG-1 protein in six subjects using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. NRG-1 mRNA was present as bands of approximately 2, 3 and 6 kb. It was clearly detected in the prefrontal cortex (middle laminae), hippocampal formation (except CA1), cerebellum, oculomotor nucleus, superior colliculus, red nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta. At the cellular level, NRG1 mRNA was abundant in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons and some interneurons, and in cerebellar Purkinje cells and Golgi cells. NRG-1 protein was detected as bands of approximately 140, 110, 95 and 60 kD. Immunohistochemistry revealed NRG-1 in many cell populations, consistent with the mRNA data, being prominent in pyramidal neurons, Purkinje cells, several brainstem nuclei, and white matter neurons. Moderate NRG-1 immunoreactivity was also observed in cerebellar and dentate gyrus granule cells, and some glia. Within neurons, NRG-1 staining was primarily somatodendritic; in the cell body staining was granular, with clustering close to the plasma and nuclear membranes. There was also labeling of some fiber tracts, and local areas of neuropil (e.g. in the dentate nucleus) suggestive of a pre-synaptic location of NRG-1. The data show a widespread expression of NRG-1 in the adult human brain, including, but not limited to, brain areas and cell populations implicated in schizophrenia. Using these normative data, future studies can ascertain whether the role of NRG-1 in the disease is mediated, or accompanied, via alterations in its expression.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Strain differences in SA gene expression in brain and kidney of normotensive and hypertensive rats.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': '1. In situ hybridization done using a 35S-cRNA probe was carried out to obtain information on the expressions of the SA gene in brains and kidneys of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) strain obtained from the Izumo colony (/Izm) and from Charles River Laboratories (/Crj). 2. In the brain, SA mRNA expression was most abundantly observed in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. High to moderate levels was present on neurons of the CA1-CA4 pyramidal cell layer and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. The solitary tract nucleus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus expressed the SA gene at very low levels. An increase in the expression was noted in the choroid plexus of WKY/Crj; there was no difference, however, in expression levels of other brain areas between WKY/Izm, SHR/Izm, and SHRSP/Izm, and between WKY/Crj and SHR/Crj. 3. In the kidney, expression signals of SA mRNA were observed in renal medullary rays and focal cortex of WKY/Izm, SHR/Izm, SHRSP/Izm, and SHR/Crj, whereas mRNA expression in the WKY/Crj kidney was observed in medullary rays and outer strips of the outer medulla. Microscopically, hybridization signals were predominant in the proximal tubules. 4. Expression densities decreased only in the kidney of WKY/Crj in 4-and 8-week-old rats, but not in the WKY/Izm kidney, compared with findings in SHR and SHRSP kidneys. These observations are in good agreement with data from Northern blot analysis. 5. The SA gene expressions in the brain and the kidney seem not to relate to states of elevated blood pressure, but rather to strain differences. Abundant expressions in the brain and the kidney may mean that the SA gene plays a role in the water-electrolyte transport system. It is noteworthy that there are neuronal expressions of the SA gene in hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Downregulation of the alpha5 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Specific subunits of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors may be regulated differentially in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy during the chronic stage. Although several subunits may be upregulated, other subunits may be downregulated in the hippocampal formation. The alpha5 subunit is of particular interest because of its relatively selective localization in the hippocampus and its potential role in tonic inhibition. In normal rats, immunolabeling of the alpha5 subunit was high in the dendritic layers of CA1 and CA2 and moderate in these regions of CA3. In chronic pilocarpine-treated rats displaying recurrent seizures, alpha5 subunit-labeling was substantially decreased in CA1 and nearly absent in CA2. Only slight decreases in immunolabeling were evident in CA3. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that the alpha5 subunit mRNA was also strongly decreased in stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA2. Thus, the alterations in localization of the alpha5 subunit peptide and its mRNA were highly correlated. The large decreases in labeling of the alpha5 subunit did not appear to be related to loss of pyramidal neurons in CA1 or CA2 since these neurons were generally preserved in pilocarpine-treated animals. No comparable decreases in labeling of the alpha2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor were detected. These findings indicate that the alpha5 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is capable of substantial and prolonged downregulation in remaining pyramidal neurons in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The results raise the possibility that presumptive extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor subunits, such as the alpha5 subunit, may be regulated differently than synaptically located subunits, such as the alpha2 subunit, within the same brain regions in some pathological conditions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainate receptors are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus. Mice with disruption of kainate receptor subunits allow the genetic dissection of the role of each kainate receptor subunits in the synaptic physiology of the hippocampus, as well as in excitotoxic processes. We have compared the action of domoate and kainate on CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices from wild-type and GluR6-/- mice. The difference in the amplitude of inward currents evoked by domoate and kainate between wild-type and GluR6-/- mice demonstrates the presence of functional kainate receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Block of domoate-activated inward currents by the AMPA receptor antagonists 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfonyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (1 microM) and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl7, 8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) (GYKI 53655) (50 microM) is complete in GluR6-/- mice but only partial in wild-type mice. In the presence of GYKI 53655, kainate receptor activation dramatically increases the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells from wild-type, as well as GluR6-/-, mice. This results from the kainate receptor-mediated activation of a sustained inward current and an increased action potential firing in afferent GABAergic interneurons of the CA1 field. These effects are observed in wild-type, as well as GluR6-/-, mice. Kainate receptors also decrease the amplitude of evoked IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells by increasing synaptic failures in wild-type and GluR6-/- mice. These results indicate that in CA1 pyramidal cells, distinct subtypes of kainate receptors mediate several functionally antagonistic effects.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The growth-associated protein GAP-43 is a presynaptic membrane phosphoprotein that plays a key role in guiding the growth of axons and in modulating the formation of new synapses. To identify the cells that synthesize GAP-43 mRNA, we applied direct in situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (in situ RT-PCR) in cerebellum and hippocampus of adult rat brain. In situ RT-PCR revealed GAP-43 mRNA in cerebellar granule cells, in Purkinje cells and in some interneurons of the molecular layer. Previous in situ hybridization studies had demonstrated a dense label throughout the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex but no labeling of other cerebellar neurons. Hippocampal cells showing distinct GAP-43 mRNA signal after in situ RT-PCR were CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, CA4 hilar cells, and dentate gyrus granule cells, whereas in situ hybridization studies had detected GAP-43 mRNA only in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our data indicate that GAP-43 mRNA is widely distributed, suggesting that many cell types are potentially involved in synaptic plasticity events. (J Histochem Cytochem 49:1195-1196, 2001)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recently, the authors isolated a novel gene of the HSP110 family, ischemia responsive protein 94 kDa (irp94), and demonstrated the expression of this gene after transient forebrain ischemia. In the current study, the authors investigated the expression profiles of all HSP110 family members including hsp110/105 and osp94/apg-1, after transient forebrain ischemia using rat four-vessel occlusion model. Among three members of the HSP110 family, induction of hsp110/105 was the most prominent after ischemia. hsp110/105 mRNA expression was clearly enhanced from 4 to 24 hours after a 6-minute or longer ischemic period. First, hsp110/105 mRNA expression was induced in the dentate gyrus, and later in the pyramidal layer. HSP110/105 protein expression also was enhanced by a 6-minute or longer period of ischemia. Profiles of HSP110/105 expression after ischemia were similar to those of inducible HSP70. After transient forebrain ischemia for 10 minutes, HSP110/105 protein was induced in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 pyramidal layer, but not in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, 6 minutes of ischemia induced the HSP110/105 protein, as well as the HSP70 protein, in the CA1 region. CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing HSP110/105 acquired tolerance against subsequent severe ischemia. In conclusion, HSP110/105 showed the most prominent induction after ischemia among the three HSP110 gene family members. Colocalization of HSP110/105 and HSP70 in the CA1 neurons that acquired tolerance suggested that induced HSP110/105 might contribute to ischemic tolerance together with HSP70.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of the neural form of nitric oxide synthase by CA1 hippocampal neurons and other central nervous system neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Nitric oxide can act as a neurotransmitter and a retrograde modulator of synaptic transmission, but uncontrolled nitric oxide synthase activity has been associated with neural degeneration. Although earlier studies using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and NADPH-diaphorase staining had suggested that nitric oxide synthase is not expressed in the CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, we have recently demonstrated that NADPH-diaphorase activity can be detected in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. To confirm that this diaphorase activity reflects nitric oxide synthase, we have developed a more sensitive in situ hybridization procedure, and an RNase protection assay to detect message for constitutive nitric oxide synthase, the form constitutively expressed in many neurons. Message for constitutive nitric oxide synthase is expressed in the hippocampus, and it is localized to neural cell layers CA1, CA3, the dentate gyrus and some displaced neurons, but not to CA2. Expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase message in the CA1 region was lost when pyramidal neurons died due to transient forebrain ischemia, supporting the conclusion that CA1 pyramidal cells express constitutive nitric oxide synthase. Although constitutive nitric oxide synthase message is strongly expressed in CA3 and the dentate gyrus, there is little diaphorase activity in these cells, suggesting that there may be post-transcriptional controls that limit constitutive nitric oxide synthase expression in some cells. Message for constitutive nitric oxide synthase is also present in a number of other regions, including the amygdala, several hypothalamic nuclei, the cerebellum, the olfactory bulb, two distinct regions of the perirhinal cortex, the subthalamic nuclei, a neuronal layer in the retrosplenial granular cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the presubiculum, the inferior colliculus, the superior colliculus, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, and scattered individual neurons in the cortex, hippocampus and brainstem. These studies support a role for nitric oxide in multiple regions of the central nervous system. In particular, nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of nitric oxide, is expressed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that nitric oxide may play a major role in long-term potentiation. CA1 hippocampal neurons are an example of a population of neurons that express constitutive nitric oxide synthase but are very sensitive to excitotoxicity and ischemic insults.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Accuracy of hippocampal network activity is disrupted by neuroinflammation: rescue by memantine.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Understanding how the hippocampus processes episodic memory information during neuropathological conditions is important for treatment and prevention applications. Previous data have shown that during chronic neuroinflammation the expression of the plasticity related behaviourally-induced immediate early gene Arc is altered within the CA3 and the dentate gyrus; both of these hippocampal regions show a pronounced increase in activated microglia. Low doses of memantine, a low to moderate affinity open channel uncompetitive N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, reduce neuroinflammation, return Arc expression to control levels and attenuate cognitive deficits induced by lipopolysaccharide. Here we investigate whether neuroinflammation affects the accuracy of information processing in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions and if this is modified by memantine treatment. Using the immediate early gene-based brain-imaging method called cellular analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence in situ hybridization, it is possible to detect primary transcripts at the genomic alleles; this provides exceptional temporal and cellular resolution and facilitates the mapping of neuronal activity. Here, we use this method to compare the neuronal populations activated by two separate experiences in CA1 and CA3 and evaluate the accuracy of information processing during chronic neuroinflammation. Our results show that the CA3 pyramidal neuron activity is not stable between two exposures to the same environment context or two different contexts. CA1 networks, however, do not differ from control conditions. These data suggest that during chronic neuroinflammation, the CA3 networks show a disrupted ability to encode spatial information, and that CA1 neurons can work independently of CA3. Importantly, memantine treatment is able to partially normalize information processing in the hippocampus, suggesting that when given early during the development of the pathology memantine confers neuronal and cognitive protection while indirectly prevents pathological microglial activation.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Decreased expression and functionality of NMDA receptor complexes persist in the CA1, but not in the dentate gyrus after transient cerebral ischemia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The authors investigated the gene expression of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the functional electrophysiologic activity of NMDA receptor complexes in the vulnerable CA1 and less vulnerable dentate gyrus subfields of the rat hippocampus at different times after transient cerebral ischemia. Decreased expression for both subtypes was observed in both the CA1 subfield and dentate granule cell layer at early times after challenge; however, the decreased expression in the dentate granule cell layer was reversible because mRNA levels for both the NR2A and NR2B subtypes recovered to, or surpassed, sham-operated mRNA levels by 3 days postchallenge. No recovery of expression for either subtype was observed in the CA1 subfield. The functional activity of NMDA receptor complexes, as assessed by slow field excitatory postsynaptic potentiations (slow f-EPSP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons, was maintained at 6 hours postchallenge; however, this activity was diminished greatly by 24 hours postchallenge, and absent at 7 days postchallenge. A similar pattern was observed for the non-NMDA receptor-mediated fast f-EPSP. In dentate granule neurons, however, no significant change in NMDA receptor-mediated slow f-EPSP from sham control was observed at any time after insult. The non-NMDA receptor-generated fast f-EPSPs also were maintained at all times postinsult in the dentate gyrus. These results illustrate that the activity of NMDA receptors remains functional in dentate granule neurons, but not in the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 subfield, at early and intermediate times after transient cerebral ischemia, and suggest that there is a differential effect of ischemia on the glutamatergic transmission systems in these two hippocampal subfields.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Periodic changes in ovarian steroid levels during fertility cycles affect learning both in humans and in rats in parallel with electrophysiological and morphological fluctuations in selective neuronal populations. In particular, during the estrous cycle of the female rat, hippocampal CA1 region undergoes cyclic modifications in synaptic density. To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic remodeling during the estrous cycle, we analyzed the expression of three presynaptic markers, synaptotagmin I, synaptotagmin IV, and synaptophysin, in the female adult rat brain by in situ hybridization. Relative abundance in mRNA for these three markers was quantified at four phases of the estrous cycle: diestrus, proestrus (AM and PM), and estrus. mRNA levels for syt1 exhibited cyclic variations in pyramidal neurons of the CA3 region of hippocampus during the estrous cycle, while mRNA levels for syt4 and SYN were relatively invariant in this or other regions of the hippocampus. Because CA3 pyramidal neurons make synaptic contacts in CA1, modulation of syt1 expression in CA3 may participate in the changes in synaptic density observed in CA1 during the estrous cycle. Furthermore, both syt1 and SYN mRNA varied cyclically in layer II, but not in layer III of entorhinal cortex, while syt4 remained unchanged throughout the cycle. These data suggest that regular variations in steroid hormone levels during fertility cycles may alter the properties of several networks involved in information processing and learning and memory through altered levels of presynaptic proteins.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cholecystokinin (CCK) can be a potent anticonvulsant neuropeptide in certain seizure models. Therefore, we examined whether seizures produced by electrical kindling of the amygdala or electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) would affect the expression of CCK mRNA in rat brain. Following a single kindled seizure, CCK mRNA expression was decreased about 20-58% in the amygdala. In contrast, after multiple consecutive kindled seizures, CCK mRNA expression was increased in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and dentate hilus. A single ECS produced no effect on CCK mRNA expression, but multiple ECS increased expression in the interneurons of the hippocampus 24 h after the last seizure. Since seizures produced by ECS can be anticonvulsant to further ECS or kindled seizures, the CCK increases in the hippocampus may represent a compensatory anticonvulsant adaptation observed in both models. Overall, the kindling-induced alterations in CCK expression appear to be more complex involving multiple brain regions and distinct temporal properties.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Several genetically engineered models exist that mimic aspects of the pathological and cognitive hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report on a novel mouse model generated by targeted knock-in of transgenes containing mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and microtubule-associated protein tau genes, inserted into the HPRT locus and controlled by the CaMKIIα regulatory element. These mice were crossed with an asymptomatic presenilin1A246E overexpressing line to generate PLB1Triple mice. Gene expression analysis and in situ hybridization confirmed stable, forebrain-specific, and gene-dose-dependent transgene expression. Brain tissue harvested from homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type cohorts aged between 3 and 24\\xa0months was analyzed immunohistochemically and electrophysiologically. Homozygous PLB1Triple offspring presented with mostly intracellular cortical and hippocampal human APP/amyloid, first detected reliably at 6\\xa0months. Human tau was already uncovered at 3\\xa0months (phospho-tau at 6\\xa0months) and labeling intensifying progressively with age. Gene-dose dependence was confirmed in age-matched heterozygous females that accumulated less tau and amyloid protein. General excitability of hippocampal neurones was not altered in slices from PLB1Triple mice up to 12\\xa0months, but 2-year-old homozygous PLB1Triple mice had smaller synaptically evoked postsynaptic potentials compared with wild\\xa0types. Synaptic plasticity (paired-pulse depression/facilitation and long-term potentiation) of synaptic CA1 pyramidal cell responses was deficient from 6\\xa0months of age. Long-term depression was not affected at any age or in any genotype. Therefore, despite comparatively subtle gene expression and protein build-up, PLB1Triple mice develop age-dependent progressive phenotypes, suggesting that aggressive protein accumulation is not necessary to reconstruct endophenotypes of AD. \",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Long-term exposure to high corticosterone levels attenuates serotonin responses in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies indicated that hyperactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal system is a considerable risk factor for the precipitation of affective disorders, most notably of major depression. The mechanism by which this hyperactivity eventually leads to clinical symptoms of depression is unknown. In the present animal study, we tested one possible mechanism, i.e., that long-term exposure to high corticosterone levels alters functional responses to serotonin in the hippocampus, an important area in the etiology of depression. Rats were injected daily for 3 weeks with a high dose of corticosterone; electrophysiological responses to serotonin were recorded intracellularly from CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. We observed that daily injections with corticosterone gradually attenuate the membrane hyperpolarization and resistance decrease mediated by serotonin-1A receptors. We next used single-cell antisense RNA amplification from identified CA1 pyramidal neurons to resolve whether the functional deficits in serotonin responsiveness are accompanied by decreased expression levels of the serotonin-1A receptor. It appeared that expression of serotonin-1A receptors in CA1 pyramidal cells is not altered; this result was supported by in situ hybridization. Expression of corticosteroid receptors in the same cells, particularly of the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor, was significantly reduced after long-term corticosterone treatment. The present findings indicate that prolonged elevation of the corticosteroid concentration, a possible causal factor for major depression in humans, gradually attenuates responsiveness to serotonin without necessarily decreasing serotonin-1A receptor mRNA levels in pyramidal neurons. These functional changes may occur by a posttranscriptional mechanism or by transcriptional regulation of genes other than the serotonin-1A receptor gene itself.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated cation channels composed of alpha and beta subunits. nAChR subunit expression is highly regulated during development. Previous studies have revealed increased expression of alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, and beta4 subunit mRNAs and alpha7 binding sites during hippocampal and cortical development. Here, we examined the expression of alpha2 subunit mRNA in rat cortex and hippocampus using highly sensitive radioactive in situ hybridization. alpha2 Subunit mRNA expression was first detected at P3 in cortex and hippocampus. During postnatal development the distribution of alpha2 subunit mRNA expression was spatially similar to the one found in adult, exhibiting highly restricted expression in scattered cells mostly in cortical layer V and retrosplenial cortex, and in scattered cells in CA1/CA3 stratum oriens and CA3 stratum radiatum. However, the expression intensity and number of alpha2 positive cells strongly increased to reach peak levels in both cortex and hippocampus at P7 and decreased thereafter to moderate to low to levels. Double in situ hybridization revealed that most, but not all, alpha2 mRNA expression was located in non-pyramidal GAD-positive cortical and hippocampal interneurons. Thus, similar to other nAChR subunits, alpha2 mRNA expression is transiently upregulated during postnatal development and nAChRs containing alpha2 subunits could regulate GABAergic activity during a critical period of network formation.',\n",

A positive hybridization signal was detected in pyramidal cell layers CA1-CA4 of Ammon's horn (CA), pyramidal cells of subiculum and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus.

In the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, decrease of NMDAR1 mRNA levels was not observed until death of the CA1 pyramidal cells. Reactive astrocytes, which appear after CA1 pyramidal cell death, expressed few NMDAR1. The CA3 and dentate gyrus also showed a reduction of NMDAR1 mRNA levels 7 days after ischemia. Temporal profiles of NMDAR1 mRNA levels correlated well with those of NMDA receptor-binding in the CA1 and CA3/dentate gyrus. These results indicate that NMDA receptors in the CA1 are predominantly located on the CA1 pyramidal cells and that these receptors are preserved during early recirculation period. Histologically intact neurons in the CA3 and dentate gyrus also had marked modulation in glutamatergic neurotransmission after ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pattern completion, the ability to retrieve complete memories on the basis of incomplete sets of cues, is a crucial function of biological memory systems. The extensive recurrent connectivity of the CA3 area of hippocampus has led to suggestions that it might provide this function. We have tested this hypothesis by generating and analyzing a genetically engineered mouse strain in which the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor gene is ablated specifically in the CA3 pyramidal cells of adult mice. The mutant mice normally acquired and retrieved spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze, but they were impaired in retrieving this memory when presented with a fraction of the original cues. Similarly, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in mutant mice displayed normal place-related activity in a full-cue environment but showed a reduction in activity upon partial cue removal. These results provide direct evidence for CA3 NMDA receptor involvement in associative memory recall.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Neuronal death and neurotrophin gene expression: long-lasting stimulation of neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA in the degenerating CA1 and CA4 pyramidal cell layers.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Neurotrophin-3 has been characterized as the product of a gene cloned by homology with nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Recombinant neurotrophin-3, like nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, has been shown to enhance survival and differentiation of specific neuronal populations in vitro. However, little is known about its function and regulation in vivo. Both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor messenger RNAs increased in adult rat brain, in a wide range of excitatory paradigms. In contrast, neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA decreased in some of them. Neurotrophin-3 is the most highly expressed neutrophic factor in immature areas of the central nervous system. However, no stimulation of its expression in the mature central nervous system, either in physiological or pathological conditions, has been described to date. This behaviour suggests that neurotrophin-3 could be involved in biological roles different from the prototypes nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Excitatory amino acid receptor-mediated neurotoxicity (excitotoxicity) is believed to contribute to neuronal loss in a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions (for a review, see Ref. 17). Moreover, locally increased levels of the endogenous excitotoxin quinolinic acid may be involved in the natural development of neurodegenerative diseases. The unilateral intrahippocampal injection of 120 nmol of quinolinic acid induced seizures together with local neurodegeneration in specific cell layers. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to analyse the spatiotemporal pattern of expression of neurotrophin-3. As in other excitotoxic paradigms, neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA clearly decreased, nearly disappearing, in the contralateral hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Group I mGlu receptors regulate the expression of the neuronal calcium sensor protein VILIP-1 in vitro and in vivo: implications for mGlu receptor-dependent hippocampal plasticity?',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are involved in several forms of synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus. Agonists which activate group I mGlu receptors induce slow-onset potentiation without prior tetanization in the hippocampal area CA1. Activation of group I mGlu receptors induces protein synthesis which may contribute to mGlu receptor-dependent forms of long-term plasticity. Calcium-binding proteins are widely considered to comprise key elements for synaptic plasticity. Therefore, we investigated whether the calcium sensor protein VILIP-1 is associated with group I mGlu receptor-mediated plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) in vivo.Application of either the group I and II mGlu agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate (ACPD) or the selective group I agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) resulted in slow-onset potentiation in the DG of adult rats. In hippocampal cell cultures both agonists elicited an enhanced expression of VILIP-1. In situ hybridization revealed strong hippocampal expression of VILIP-1 and intracerebral application of DHPG to adult rats significantly enhanced hippocampal VILIP-1 expression. The DHPG effects in both, hippocampal cultures and in vivo, were prevented by the group I mGlu receptor antagonist 4-Carboxyphenylglycine (4CPG). Calcium sensor proteins thus appear to be regulated by mGlu receptors in an activity-dependent manner. A specific role for group I mGlu receptors is evident. Furthermore, the sensor proteins may function as molecular switches for the long-term regulation of synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Hippocampal cell loss, atrophy and cholinergic dysfunction are also features of AD. The present work is aimed at studying the interactions between cholinergic denervation, APP processing and hippocampal integrity. The cholinergic immunotoxin mu p-75-saporin was injected into the 3rd ventricle of 6- to 8-month-old Tg2576 mice to induce a cholinergic denervation. Four weeks after cholinergic immunolesion, a significant 14-fold increase of soluble Aβ1-42 was observed. Cholinergically lesioned Tg2576 mice showed hippocampal atrophy together with degenerating FluoroJade-B-stained neurons and reduction of synaptophysin expression in CA1-3 pyramidal layers. We also found that cholinergic denervation led to reduced levels of ADAM17 in hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Inhibition of ADAM17 with TAPI-2 (5 μM) decreased viability of hippocampal primary neurons from Tg2576 brains and decreased phosphorylation of downstream effectors of trophic signalling (ERK and Akt). The cholinergic agonist carbachol (100 μM) rescued these effects, suggesting that cholinergic deficits might render hippocampus more vulnerable to neurotoxicity upon certain toxic environments. The present work proposes a novel model of AD that worsens the patent amyloid pathology of Tg2576 mice together with hippocampal synaptic pathology and neurodegeneration. Drugs aimed at favoring cholinergic transmission should still be considered as potential treatments of AD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. The axonal plexus of most hippocampal interneurons is restricted to certain strata within the target region. This lamination suggests a possible functional heterogeneity of inhibitory synapses between different interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cells. 2. We therefore compared inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and currents (IPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells, which were evoked from two stimulation sites (stratum oriens and stratum radiatum). Stimulation in stratum oriens yielded faster decaying IPSPs and IPSCs than stimulation in stratum radiatum. 3. IPSP and IPSC kinetics were regulated by GABA uptake in both layers as indicated by the prolongation of the signals under tiagabine, a GAT-1 (neuronal GABA plasma membrane transporter)-specific GABA-uptake blocker. However, the effect of tiagabine was significantly more pronounced following stimulation in stratum radiatum than in stratum oriens (prolongation of IPSC half-decay time by 167 vs. 115 %, respectively). 4. In situ hybridization with antisense mRNA for the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65/67) and the GABA transporter GAT-1 showed that the proportion of interneurons expressing GAT-1 was lower in stratum oriens than in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare. 5. From these functional and molecular data we conclude that the regulation of IPSP and IPSC kinetics in CA1 pyramidal cells by neuronal GABA uptake differs between layers. Our findings suggest that this laminar difference is caused by a lower expression of GAT-1 in interneurons in stratum oriens than in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Brief forebrain ischemia in rodents induces selective and delayed neuronal death, particularly of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neuronal death is preceded by down-regulation specific to CA1 of GluR2, the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit that limits Ca(2+) influx. This alteration is hypothesized to cause neurodegeneration by permitting a lethal influx of Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) through newly formed GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors. Two days of mild hypothermia induced 1 h after ischemia potently and lastingly protects against ischemic injury. We examined molecular mechanisms underlying hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. We report that hypothermia rescues most hippocampal CA1 neurons from ischemia-induced cell death and attenuates ischemia-induced down-regulation of mRNA encoding the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2. Ischemia induced a marked down-regulation of GluR2 mRNA and a small down-regulation of GluR1 mRNA in CA1 at 2 days, as assessed by quantitative in situ hybridization. The ischemia-induced changes in gene expression were cell-specific in that GluR2 was not significantly altered in CA3 or dentate gyrus. After ischemia treated by hypothermia GluR2 mRNA expression was modestly reduced at 2 days and exhibited complete recovery to control levels at 7 days. Hypothermia prevented ischemia induced changes in GluR1 mRNA expression. These findings suggest that intervention at the level of transcriptional regulation of the GluR2 gene may be a mechanism by which prolonged postischemic cooling rescues CA1 neurons otherwise \"destined to die.\"',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are glucocorticoid-activated transcription factors essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Differential activation of these adrenocorticosteroid receptors (ACR) is thought to influence neuronal viability, particularly under challenging cellular conditions. The present study is designed to determine the effects of receptor blockade and excitotoxic insult on MR and GR mRNA expression and neuronal viability in hippocampus. Male Sprague--Dawley rats were pretreated for 48 hr with vehicle, MR antagonist spironolactone (SPIRO) (50 mg/kg, twice daily, s.c.), or GR antagonist RU486 (25 mg/kg, twice daily, s.c.) and subsequently injected with saline or the glutamate analog kainic acid (KA) (12 mg/kg i.p.). Twenty-four hr post-insult, MR and GR mRNA levels were assessed by in situ hybridization analysis, and hippocampal neurons were counted to assess KA-induced cell loss. MR blockade with SPIRO increased basal MR mRNA levels in hippocampal subregions CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) and increased basal GR mRNA levels in CA3. GR blockade with RU486 increased basal GR mRNA levels in CA3. The excitotoxin KA decreased MR mRNA levels in CA1 and CA3, decreased GR mRNA levels in DG, and negated all antagonist-induced increases of ACR mRNAs. Cell counts quantifying KA damage indicated increased CA3 vulnerability to KA insult after treatment with MR antagonist spironolactone but demonstrated no significant cell loss in any other group or region. These results demonstrate dynamic regulation of hippocampal MR and GR mRNAs after ACR antagonist treatment and kainate toxicity, underscoring the potential importance of MR and GR availability to neuronal viability after insult.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Previous studies have reported increased levels of amyloid protein precursor (APP) and APP mRNA in the hippocampus and basal forebrain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Similar changes have been found in the brains of aged rodents and transgenic mice. It now appears that alterations in the expression of individual isoforms of APP mRNA may have a role to play in amyloid-pathogenesis. Here we examined the effect of acute administration of the limbic system neurotoxin trimethyltin (TMT) (8 mg/kg i.p.) on APP-751 and APP-695 mRNA expression in the rat hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4) using in situ hybridization techniques. We found that following TMT treatment the expression of APP-751 mRNA was increased in CA1 pyramidal cells while that of APP-695 mRNA remained unchanged. TMT also increased the numbers of APP-751 and APP-695 mRNA positively hybridized cells in the CA1 pyramidal layer. These findings suggest that an alteration in APP mRNA expression is involved in the response of the rodent brain to TMT intoxication.\",\n",

Here we report network and behavioral deficits in mice with selective ablation of NMDA receptors in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (NR1(PVCre-/-)).

Moreover, in contrast to controls, in NR1(PVCre-/-) mice the remaining theta rhythm was abolished by the administration of atropine. Gamma oscillations (35-85 Hz) were increased and less modulated by the concurrent theta rhythm in the mutant. Positional firing of pyramidal cells in NR1(PVCre-/-) mice was less spatially and temporally precise. Finally, NR1(PVCre-/-) mice exhibited impaired spatial working as well as spatial short- and long-term recognition memory but showed no deficits in open field exploratory activity and spatial reference learning.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'After spatial exploration in rats, Arc mRNA is expressed in ∼2% of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells, and this proportion of Arc-positive neurons remains stable for ∼8 h. This long-term presence of Arc mRNA following behavior is not observed in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. We report here that in rats ∼50% of granule cells with cytoplasmic Arc mRNA, induced some hours previously during exploration, also show Arc expression in the nucleus. This suggests that recent transcription can occur long after the exploration behavior that elicited it. To confirm that the delayed nuclear Arc expression was indeed recent transcription, Actinomycin D was administered immediately after exploration. This treatment resulted in inhibition of recent Arc expression both when evaluated shortly after exploratory behavior as well as after longer time intervals. Together, these data demonstrate a unique kinetic profile for Arc transcription in hippocampal granule neurons following behavior that is not observed in other cell types. Among a number of possibilities, this sustained transcription may provide a mechanism that ensures that the synaptic connection weights in the sparse population of granule cells recruited during a given behavioral event are able to be modified.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To investigate a potential role of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in transient global ischemia, we have studied the postischemic regulatory changes in the expression of CNTF and its receptor, the ligand-binding alpha-subunit (CNTFRalpha). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated CNTF levels were slightly upregulated already during the first day after ischemia and then increased markedly by more than 10-fold until 2 weeks postischemia. Immunoreactivity for CNTF became detectable 1 day after ischemia and was localized in reactive astrocytes. The intensity of the immunolabeling was maximal in CA1 during the phase of neuronal cell death (days 3-7 postischemia) and in the deafferented inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Upregulation of CNTF expression was less pronounced in CA3 and absent in the stratum lacunosum moleculare and the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and thus did not simply correlate with astroliosis as represented by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). As shown by in situ hybridization, expression of CNTFRalpha mRNA was restricted to neurons of the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers in control animals. Following ischemia, reactive astrocytes, identified by double labeling with antibodies to GFAP, transiently expressed CNTFRalpha mRNA with a maximum around postischemic day 3. This astrocytic response was most pronounced in CA1 and in the hilar part of CA3. These results show that CNTF and its receptor are differentially regulated in activated astrocytes of the postischemic hippocampus, indicating that they are involved in the regulation of astrocytic responses and the neuronal reorganizations occurring after an ischemic insult.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Kainic acid-induced seizures in rats represent an established animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy. The neuropathological sequelae include acute status epilepticus followed by neurodegeneration in the CA1 and CA3 sector of the Ammon's horn and of interneurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. After about three weeks spontaneous recurrent seizures become manifest. We investigated changes in messenger RNA expression of 13 GABA(A) receptor subunits in the hippocampus of rats in the initial phase (6 h, 12 h and 24 h) after acute kainic acid-induced status epilepticus and seizure-related neuronal cell damage during and after acquisition of spontaneous recurrent seizures (seven and 30 days after kainic acid injection). In the granule cell layer, initial (after 6 to 12 h) decreases in (alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta1, beta3, gamma2 and delta messenger RNAs (by about 25 to 50%) were accompanied by increases (by about 50%) in alpha1, alpha4, and beta2 messages. At later intervals (after seven to 30 days), expression of alpha2, alpha4, beta3 and gamma2 messenger RNAs recovered to control values, with alpha5 and delta messenger RNA still being reduced (by 15 and 40% below control levels, respectively). Concentrations of the transcripts encoding for alpha1, alpha3, beta1, beta2, became markedly enhanced (between 20 and 50% of controls). Within the pyramidal cell layers CA1 and CA3, decreases in alpha2, alpha4, alpha5, beta(1-3) and gamma2 messenger RNAs were detected after seven to 30 days, reflecting pronounced neurodegeneration in these areas. The alpha1 transcript was decreased in CA3 after 24 h and increased to control levels indicating compensatory up-regulation of this message after seven days. Messenger RNAs encoding for alpha3-, gamma1-, and gamma3-subunits were detected at rather low levels, alpha6 was not present in the hippocampus. Our data suggest a fast but transient change in the expression of messenger RNAs encoding for different subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. This is followed by a lasting augmentation of messenger RNAs encoding different GABA(A) receptor subunits in the same cell layer indicating long-lasting GABAergic inhibition. Changes within the pyramidal cell layer are mostly determined by concomitant neurodegenerative processes.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To investigate the changes in the principal subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 1 (NR1) following the transient ischemia and postischemic hypothermia, in situ hybridization was used in the gerbil hippocampus. One of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, Glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) was also investigated to compare with NR1. Even at 1 day, NR1 and GluR2 mRNAs in the CA1 region were reduced following ischemia. Although postischemic hypothermia prevented almost all the neuronal cell death by ischemia and inhibited the reduction of NR1 and GluR2 mRNAs in the CA1 region after 7 days, the downregulation of NR1 mRNA in the CA2 region was observed even at 1 day. This change was specific for NR1 and not for GluR2. These results suggest that the changes in NR1 and GluR2 receptors at the mRNA level would occur in spite of postischemic hypothermia. The phenomenon in the CA2 region may play an important role to rescue neuronal cell death by ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Febrile seizures, in addition to being the most common seizure type of the developing human, may contribute to the generation of subsequent limbic epilepsy. Our previous work has demonstrated that prolonged experimental febrile seizures in the immature rat model increased hippocampal excitability long term, enhancing susceptibility to future seizures. The mechanisms for these profound proepileptogenic changes did not require cell death and were associated with long-term slowed kinetics of the hyperpolarization-activated depolarizing current (I(H)). Here we show that these seizures modulate the expression of genes encoding this current, the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCNs): In CA1 neurons expressing multiple HCN isoforms, the seizures induced a coordinated reduction of HCN1 mRNA and enhancement of HCN2 expression, thus altering the neuronal HCN phenotype. The seizure-induced augmentation of HCN2 expression involved CA3 in addition to CA1, whereas for HCN4, mRNA expression was not changed by the seizures in either hippocampal region. This isoform- and region-specific transcriptional regulation of the HCNs required neuronal activity rather than hyperthermia alone, correlated with seizure duration, and favored the formation of slow-kinetics HCN2-encoded channels. In summary, these data demonstrate a novel, activity-dependent transcriptional regulation of HCN molecules by developmental seizures. These changes result in long-lasting alteration of the HCN phenotype of specific hippocampal neuronal populations, with profound consequences on the excitability of the hippocampal network.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The mRNA expression patterns for the Y1, Y2, Y4 and Y5 receptor subtypes have been compared at a cellular level within consecutive coronal sections of rat hippocampus, using a uniform method of in situ hybridisation. All four receptor subtypes show different levels and patterns of expression. The Y5 receptor mRNA is most abundant and most widely distributed (CA3 > DG approximately = CA2 approximately = CA1). Numerous Y5 mRNA-expressing neurons are also observed in the dentate gyrus polymorphic layer, while several positively-labelled neurons are detected in the molecular layer and in the stratum oriens. The Y2 receptor displays lower hybridisation signal relative to the Y5, although the expression pattern is similar. Moderate levels of Y1 mRNA expression are detected in the pyramidal cell layer of CA3-CA1 fields. However, only 20% of dentate gyrus granule neurons express Y1 receptor mRNA. In contrast, Y4 receptor mRNA is much less abundant, only small subpopulations of Y4 receptor expressing neurons are detected within the dentate gyrus and the CA3 to CA1 fields. This differential Y-receptor subtype expression pattern indicates specific and separate roles for these receptors in hippocampus processing, which may prove important in dysfunctional states, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

As in humans, adult C57BL/6J mice demonstrated a great variability in their response to stress under this paradigm.

       "  'Abstract': 'The beta subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) modulate the electrophysiology and cell surface expression of pore-forming alpha1 subunits. In the present study we have investigated the distribution of beta1,beta2,beta3 and beta4 in the human hippocampus using in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry. ISH studies showed a similar distribution of expression of beta1,beta2 and beta3 subunit mRNAs, including labelling of the dentate granule cell layer, all CA pyramidal regions, and the subiculum. Relatively low levels of expression of beta1 and beta2 subunit mRNAs correlated with low protein expression in the immunocytochemical (ICC) studies. There was a relative lack of beta4 expression by both ISH and ICC in the CA1 region, compared with high levels of expression in the subiculum. Immunostaining for beta1 and beta2 subunits was weak and relatively homogeneous throughout the hippocampus. The beta3 and beta4 subunits appeared to be more discretely localized. In general, beta3-immunoreactivity was moderate both in cell bodies, and as diffuse staining in the surrounding neuropil. Strongest staining was observed in mossy fibres and their terminal region in the CA3 stratum lucidum. In contrast, beta4-immunoreactivity in the neuropil showed intense dendritic localisation. Unlike the other subunits, beta4-immunoreactivity was absent from CA1 pyramidal neurones but was present in a small population of interneurone-like cells. The localisation of beta3 and beta4 may represent presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments in some populations of hippocampal neurones. Comparison of beta subunit distribution with previously published data on alpha1 subunits indicates certain neuronal groups and subcellular compartments in which the subunit composition of native pre- and postsynaptic VDCC can be predicted.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) is a member of the family of thiol-disulfide oxido-reductases that maintain the sulfhydryl homeostasis in cells by catalyzing thiol-disulfide interchange reactions. One of the major consequences of oxidative stress in brain is formation of protein-glutathione mixed disulfide (through oxidation of protein thiols) which can be reversed by thioltransferase during recovery of brain from oxidative stress. Here we have visualized the location of thioltransferase in brain regions from seven human tissues obtained at autopsy. Constitutively expressed thioltransferase activity was detectable in all human brains examined although inter-individual variations were seen. The enzyme activity was significantly higher in hippocampus and cerebellum as compared to other regions. Constitutive expression of thioltransferase mRNA was detectable by Northern blot analysis. Localization of thioltransferase mRNA by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed its presence predominantly in neurons in the cerebral cortex, Purkinje and granule cell layers of the cerebellum, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal neurons of CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus. These discrete neuronal concentrations of thioltransferase would be consistent with an essential role in modulating recovery of protein thiols from mixed disulfides formed during oxidative stress.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'DYT1 dystonia is caused by a single GAG deletion in exon 5 of TOR1A, the gene encoding torsinA, a putative chaperone protein. In this study, central and peripheral nervous system perturbations (transient forebrain ischemia and sciatic nerve transection, respectively) were used to examine the systems biology of torsinA in rats. After forebrain ischemia, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction identified increased torsinA transcript levels in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum at 24 h and 7 days. Expression declined toward sham values by 14 days in striatum, thalamus and cortex, and by 21 days in cerebellum and hippocampus. TorsinA transcripts were localized to dentate granule cells and pyramidal neurons in control hippocampus and were moderately elevated in these cell populations at 24 h after ischemia, after which CA1 expression was reduced, consistent with the loss of this vulnerable neuronal population. Increased in situ hybridization signal in CA1 stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum-moleculare, and stratum oriens at 7 days after ischemia was correlated with the detection of torsinA immunoreactivity in interneurons and reactive astrocytes at 7 and 14 days. Sciatic nerve transection increased torsinA transcript levels between 24 h and 7 days in both ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, increased torsinA immunoreactivity was localized to both ganglion cells and satellite cells in ipsilateral DRG but was restricted to satellite cells contralaterally. These results suggest that torsinA participates in the response of neural tissue to central and peripheral insults and its sustained up-regulation indicates that torsinA may contribute to remodeling of neuronal circuitry. The striking induction of torsinA in astrocytes and satellite cells points to the potential involvement of glial elements in the pathobiology of DYT1 dystonia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In hippocampal and other cortical neurons, action potentials are followed by afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) generated by the activation of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels). By shaping the neuronal firing pattern, these AHPs contribute to the regulation of excitability and to the encoding function of neurons. Here we report that CA1 pyramidal neurons express an AHP current that is suppressed by apamin and is involved in the control of repetitive firing. This current presents distinct kinetic and pharmacological features, and it is modulated differently than the apamin-insensitive slow AHP current. Furthermore, our in situ hybridizations show that the apamin-sensitive SK subunits are expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons, providing a potential molecular correlate to the apamin-sensitive AHP current. Altogether, these results clarify the discrepancy between the reported high density of apamin-binding sites in the CA1 region and the apparent lack of an apamin-sensitive current in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and they may explain the effects of this toxin on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A single administration of the convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) initiates a complex pattern of long-term changes in microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) expression across the hippocampal formation. Using Northern blot and in situ hybridization we show that the first increases in MAP1B mRNA were detected at 15 h following PTZ administration in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the hippocampus and reached a maximum at 44 h. The levels of MAP1B mRNA in the subiculum peaked at later times (5 days). At 72 h MAP1B immunoreactivity was mainly localized in the granule-cell bodies and dentate inner and midmolecular layer as well as in neuronal cell bodies and the stratum lucidum, including the mossy fiber pathway of the CA3 region. By 5-10 days the levels of MAP1B in the pyramidal cells in the CA3 region decreased to very low levels; rather, heavy staining of interneuron-like cells and \"strings-of-bead\" structures all over the hippocampus and at the stratum oriens/alveus border were seen. The levels of MAP1B in the hippocampus returned to control levels by 20 days after PTZ administration. MAP1B immunoreactivity in the alvear path was also evident at 5 days postinjection at the CA1/alveus border. The intensity of MAP1B staining increased gradually in the perforant path starting at 72 h and persisted at high levels until day 35. Our studies show that (i) MAP1B is a temporal and regional marker for rapid and acute epileptic seizures and (ii) long-term increases in MAP1B in the perforant path might play a role in PTZ-induced seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution of galanin mRNA-expressing cells and galanin-immunoreactive (IR) cell bodies and processes was studied in the brain of mice overexpressing galanin under the PDGF-B promoter (GalOE mice) and of wild type (WT) mice, both in colchicine-treated and non-treated animals. A widespread ectopic expression of galanin (both mRNA and peptide) was found, that is when neither transcript nor peptide could be seen in WT mice, not even after colchicine treatment. However, in some regions, such as claustrum, basolateral amygdala, thalamus, CA1 pyramidal cells, and Purkinje cells only galanin mRNA could be detected. The highest levels of galanin expression were observed in the forebrain structures (the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, throughout the cortex, granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus), in the mesencephalon (nucleus ruber), in the cerebellum (lateral cerebellar nucleus), in the pons (sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve), within the medulla oblongata (facial, prepositus and spinal trigeminal nuclei). High densities of galanin-IR fibers were found in the axonal terminals of the lateral olfactory tract, hippocampal and presumably cerebellar mossy fiber system, in several thalamic and hypothalamic regions and the lower brain stem.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effects of intraventricular injection of kainic acid on the Na,K-ATPase (Na,K pump) were examined in discrete pyramidal cell regions of rat hippocampus. [3H]Ouabain binding was used to quantitate Na,K-ATPase catalytic subunits and in situ hybridization was used to determine Na,K-ATPase mRNA levels. Large decreases were found in both [3H]ouabain binding and alpha 3 isoform mRNA in hippocampus areas, especially in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer, which sustains heavy cell losses as a result of bilateral, intraventricular injection of kainic acid. Substantial decreases in the high affinity component of ouabain binding and in the alpha 3 isoform mRNA (but not isoforms for other Na,K-ATPase subunits) were also observed in the CA1 region of hippocampus, an area preserved in this model. High affinity [3H]ouabain binding was decreased 25-33% in the stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum after treatment with kainic acid, and alpha 3 mRNA was decreased by 26-50%. To further characterize the decrease in alpha 3 mRNA, animals were killed at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after injection of kainate and results show a large decrease in alpha 3 mRNA only at 2 weeks recovery time. While the pathology underlying temporal lobe epilepsy is unclear, changes in the Na,K-ATPase may be involved in abnormal firing characteristics of cells in epileptic tissue.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential regulation of CXCL12 and PACAP mRNA expression after focal and global ischemia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) and the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1) have been implicated in neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and regeneration. Focal ischemia is associated with rapid upregulation of PACAP in perifocal neurons and delayed induction of SDF-1 in hypoxic/ischemic tissues, the latter process being involved in the recruitment of stem cells and inflammatory cells. Here, we studied mRNA patterns of PACAP, SDF-1 and the cognate receptors PAC1 and CXCR4 by in situ hybridization in the rat hippocampus after transient global ischemia, a rat model for programmed death of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Cell death in CA1 was not associated with local induction of PACAP and SDF-1 expression or recruitment of CXCR4-expressing infiltrates. However, there was a transient, almost complete loss of SDF-1 expression in microvessels in all hippocampal regions. Granule cells transiently showed a decrease of SDF-1 and an increase of PACAP expression. While PAC1 mRNA was moderately decreased throughout the hippocampus, CXCR4 expression was selectively increased in the subgranular layer. We propose that altered PACAP and SDF-1 gene expression in granule cells plays a role in regulated neurogenesis after global ischemia. The finding that programmed neuronal death after global ischemia was not associated with SDF-1 upregulation or recruitment of CXCR4-expressing cells is in sharp contrast to SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated infiltration of infarct tissue after focal ischemia. Hence, the different modes of neuronal death after focal and global ischemia are associated with distinct SDF-1 and PACAP gene regulation patterns and distinct reorganization mechanisms.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Transient, severe forebrain or global ischemia leads to delayed cell death of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death after global ischemia are as yet unknown. Glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx is thought to play a critical role in this cell death. In situ hybridization revealed that the expression of mRNA encoding GluR2 (the subunit that limits Ca2+ permeability of AMPA-type glutamate receptors) was markedly and specifically reduced in gerbil CA1 pyramidal neurons after global ischemia but before the onset of neurodegeneration. To determine whether the change in GluR2 expression is functionally significant, we examined the AMPA receptor-mediated rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i) in individual CA1 pyramidal neurons by optical imaging with the Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2 and by intracellular recording. Seventy-two hours after ischemia, CA1 neurons that retained the ability to fire action potentials exhibited a greatly enhanced AMPA-elicited rise in [Ca2+]i. Basal [Ca2+]i in these neurons was unchanged. These findings provide evidence for Ca2+ entry directly through AMPA receptors in pyramidal neurons destined to die. Downregulation of GluR2 gene expression and an increase in Ca2+ influx through AMPA receptors in response to endogenous glutamate are likely to contribute to the delayed neuronal death after global ischemia.',\n",

The semaphorins are a large, phylogenetically conserved protein family with important roles in neural development. However, semaphorin function in the adult brain has yet to be determined. Here, we show that the coreceptors for secreted semaphorins, the neuropilins, are found at synapses and localize to molecular layers of the adult mouse hippocampus and accessory olfactory cortex. Moreover, application of the secreted semaphorin Sema3F to acute hippocampal slices modulates both the frequency and amplitude of miniature EPSCs in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurons of CA1. Finally, we show that mice lacking Sema3F are prone to seizures. These results suggest a novel role for semaphorins as synaptic modulators and illustrate the diverse repertoire of these guidance cues in both the formation and function of neural circuits.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The postnatal expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain, including the hippocampus, exhibits a unique temporal and regional developmental profile in vivo, which may be altered by external stimuli. Using the in situ hybridization technique we have now studied the in vitro expression of alpha1,alpha2, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, gamma 2, and gamma 3 subunit mRNAs of GABA(A) receptors in organotypic hippocampal slices cultured for 7 days. To find out whether neuronal activity regulates the subunit expression, a subset of cultures was chronically treated either with a GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin, or by a non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA)-receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX). In untreated control cultures, the expression pattern of the subunits varied regionally, the most abundantly expressed subunits being alpha 2 and alpha 5 in all subregions. All studied subunits were expressed in CA3a/b and CA1, whereas in CA3c and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) no signal of alpha 4 and gamma 3 was detected. The drug treatment differently affected the regional subunit expression. In picrotoxin-treated cultures, the expression of alpha1, alpha 5 and gamma 2 mRNAs was significantly increased in pyramidal cell layers, and in DNQX-treated cultures the expression of alpha2 mRNA in CA3c and DG, and that of beta1 in DG. Changes in the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs in treated cultures suggest that neuronal activity can regulate their regional expression in vitro. Since the expression profile in untreated control cultures closely resembled that observed earlier in vivo, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures could serve as a good model system to study the regulatory mechanisms of receptor expression under well-controlled experimental conditions in the developing hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainic acid-induced limbic seizures enhance expression of tenascin-C (TN) in the hippocampus of adult rats. TN mRNA was detectable by in situ hybridization in many granule cells in the dentate gyrus 4.5 hr after kainic acid injection but not in saline-injected animals (controls) or in animals killed 2 or 24 hr after injection. Thirty days after kainic acid injection, TN mRNA was detectable only in pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1. At the protein level, TN was detectable by immunocytochemistry in control animals in the strata oriens and lacunosum moleculare of CA1, in the molecular layer, and within a narrow area at the inner surface of the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus. Twenty-four hours after kainic acid injection, TN immunoreactivity was enhanced in these areas and throughout the granule cell layer. Thirty days after kainic acid injection, TN immunoreactivity was downregulated in these areas, while it was prominent in the stratum oriens and in clusters of immunoreactivity in the stratum lucidum of CA3. Western blot analysis of the hippocampus showed a peak of TN expression 24 hr after kainic acid injection. These observations show that TN expression is upregulated in predominantly neuronal cells already by 4.5 hr after kainic acid injection, coincident with activation of granule cells and sprouting of axon terminals, whereas the remaining TN expression 30 days after injection relates to pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3, coincident with an astroglial response, as marked by a strong expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The transcription factor neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4 (Npas4) is an inducible immediate early gene which regulates the formation of inhibitory synapses, and could have a significant regulatory role during cortical circuit formation. However, little is known about basal Npas4 mRNA expression during postnatal development. Here, postnatal and adult mouse brain sections were processed for isotopic in situ hybridization using an Npas4 specific cRNA antisense probe. In adults, Npas4 mRNA was found in the telencephalon with very restricted or no expression in diencephalon or mesencephalon. In most telencephalic areas, including the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), piriform cortex, neocortex, hippocampus, dorsal caudate putamen (CPu), septum and basolateral amygdala nucleus (BLA), basal Npas4 expression was detected in scattered cells which exhibited strong hybridization signal. In embryonic and neonatal brain sections, Npas4 mRNA expression signals were very low. Starting at postnatal day 5 (P5), transcripts for Npas4 were detected in the AON, CPu and piriform cortex. At P8, additional Npas4 hybridization was found in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal layer, and in primary motor cortex. By P13, robust mRNA expression was located in layers IV and VI of all sensory cortices, frontal cortex and cingulate cortex. After onset of expression, postnatal spatial mRNA distribution was similar to that in adults, with the exception of the CPu, where Npas4 transcripts became gradually restricted to the most dorsal part. In conclusion, the spatial distribution of Npas4 mRNA is mostly restricted to telencephalic areas, and the temporal expression increases with developmental age during postnatal development, which seem to correlate with the onset of activity-driven excitatory transmission.

       "  'Title': 'Synaptic vesicle protein synaptoporin is differently expressed by subpopulations of mouse hippocampal neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In the hippocampus, the synaptic vesicle protein synaptoporin (SPO) has been reported to be exclusively enriched in the granule cell axons, the mossy fibers. In this study, we show that in adult rats and mice SPO immunoreactivity (IR) is also detectable in strata oriens, radiatum, and lacunosum-moleculare of CA1-CA3, as well as perisomatically in the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata. In situ hybridization confirmed that SPO mRNA was present in granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells but not in CA1 pyramidal cells. Importantly, cells scattered throughout the hippocampal layers resembling the distribution of interneurons were found to synthesize high amounts of SPO mRNA, too. Thus, these findings indicate that SPO expression in the hippocampus was underestimated until now. Moreover, double-labeling immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed selective colocalization of SPO and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD 65), a marker for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic terminals. To identify SPO expressing interneurons, in situ hybridization was combined with immunocytochemistry against parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), cholecystokinin (CCK), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). We found that SPO transcripts were differentially expressed by various interneuron subpopulations in the hippocampus of C57Bl/6 mice (PV 44.2%, CB 46.3%, CR 19.3%, CCK 38.6%, VIP 59.9%). Immunoelectron microscopy for SPO labeled synaptic vesicle profiles in distinct symmetric and asymmetric synapses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that hippocampal principal cells and interneurons display a variety of synaptic vesicles that are likely to contribute to the functional characteristics of their output synapses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated pentameric cation channels of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha5 subunit, when added to heteromeric complexes, alters pharmacological and physiological properties of nAChRs, which may be important during development. Here we have evaluated the pre- and postnatal expression of alpha5 subunit mRNA in rat cortex and hippocampus using highly sensitive in situ hybridization. In the cortex, alpha5 mRNA was detected in the subplate, claustrum, and endopiriform nucleus at embryonic day 18 (E18), areas with sustained expression into adulthood. Transient cortical expression was detected in numerous cells, scattered mainly in layers V and II/III, during the first 2 postnatal weeks. In the hippocampus, alpha5 transcripts first appeared in the CA1 region at E18. During postnatal development, increased hybridization signal was detected in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and granule cells of the dentate gyrus, which strongly contrasted with the low levels in the adult. Interneurons in CA1/CA3 stratum radiatum and moleculare, and in the hilus region of the dentate gyrus, strongly expressed alpha5 mRNA in postnatal and adult animals. With double in situ hybridization, co-expression of alpha5 and alpha7 mRNAs was detected in a subpopulation of hippocampal interneurons. In contrast, in the subiculum, numerous cells exhibited strong hybridization signal for alpha5 and alpha7 mRNAs, but co-expression was rarely detected. In conclusion, similar to other nAChR subunits, there is transient expression of alpha5 mRNA during cortical and hippocampal development. This expression pattern places nicotinic receptors containing the alpha5 subunit in a position to regulate glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission during the postnatal period.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using in situ hybridization histochemistry concentrations of mRNAs encoding chromogranin A (ChA), carboxypeptidase H (CPH) and peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxigenase (PAM) have been investigated in the hippocampus after kainic acid (KA)-induced limbic seizures in the rat. Increased concentrations (by 150%) of ChA and CPH mRNAs were found in the granule cell layer 24 h after KA injection. At the same time PAM mRNA levels were only slightly elevated (by 50%). Whereas the increases in CPH and PAM transcripts were only transient, ChA mRNA concentrations in the granule cell layer were elevated up to 2 months after the initial seizures. In contrast, in the pyramidal cell layers of all hippocampal subfields (CA1 to CA3) ChA mRNA concentrations were significantly reduced (by 40-70%) 1-60 days after KA. PAM and CPH messages were slightly reduced in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 but not in CA2 and CA3. The experiments demonstrate that KA-induced limbic seizures cause sustained changes in the expression of ChA mRNA. At the same time the expression of two enzymes involved in post-translational processing of neuropeptides, PAM and CPH, becomes only transiently altered. Synthesis of ChA may be regulated differently in the strata granulosum and pyramidale during epileptic seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Effects of barbiturates have been linked to the inhibitory GABAA receptor in the brain. The present study examines changes in the expression of GABAA receptor in the hippocampus of pentobarbital treated rat. Intraperitoneal pentobarbital injections were administered once daily for 9 days at an increasing dose schedule, 30 mg/kg at day 1-3, 60 mg/kg day 4-6, and 90 mg/kg day 7-9. Within each of the three dosage periods, the duration of sleep and extent of reduction in body temperature of the rats decreased with time. Two hours after the 9th injection, 3H-muscimol binding of the hippocampal homogenates of the animals showed that the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax), 10.2 +/- 1.6 pmol/mg protein, was not significantly greater than 9.5 +/- 1.2 of saline control, but strikingly about 7-fold control level of beta 1 mRNA was seen in the pyramidal cells of CA1 and CA2, as revealed by in situ hybridization analysis with digoxigenin-cRNA probes. However, when the rats were withdrawn from pentobarbital injection for 24 hours and 7 days, the Bmax of the hippocampi was lowered to 7.3 +/- 1.0 and 5.1 +/- 0.7, respectively, and the expression of beta 1 mRNA in CA1-2 returned toward control. The pentobarbital treatment did not significantly alter the affinity of the radioligand to the receptor in the hippocampus and the expression of beta 1 mRNA in CA3 and CA4. The results suggest the plasticity of the beta 1 mRNA in CA1-2 as well as differential involvement of CA1-2 and CA3-4 in response to the pentobarbital perturbation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"We examined whether 7-Cl-thio-kynurenate, a potent antagonist at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor which also inhibits lipid peroxidation, protected CA1 pyramidal cells following transient forebrain ischemia. Global ischemia was produced in anesthetized gerbils by 5 min bilateral carotid artery occlusion; hippocampal injury was assessed seven days later. 7-Cl-thio-kynurenate (100 mg/kg, i.p. x 5) dramatically attenuated ischemia-induced CA1 cell loss (from 95 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 3%): the protection was associated with a delayed and marked reduction in the animals' temperature. However, when the gerbils were maintained normothermic for at least 360 min, 7-Cl-thio-kynurenate still provided partial (54 +/- 11%) but significant protection. No protection was observed when a reduction in temperature with a time course similar to that caused by 7-Cl-thio-kynurenate was experimentally induced in saline-treated ischemic animals. In situ hybridization revealed that expression of NMDA-R1, a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, was selectively reduced in CA1 seven days following global ischemia. In ischemic gerbils treated with 7-Cl-thio-kynurenate, protected CA1 cells were still able to express normal amounts of NMDA-R1 messenger RNA. Our results demonstrate that 7-Cl-thio-kynurenate, a glutamate receptor blocker possessing radical scavenger properties, is effective in reducing CA1 hippocampal damage following global ischemia in the gerbil. Since there is growing evidence that a positive feedback interaction between activation of glutamate receptors and free radical formation may be responsible for the generation of ischemic brain damage, drugs capable of interfering with both pathogenic mechanisms may be useful in preventing post-ischemic neuronal death.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'An in situ hybridization procedure was applied to quantify glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNAs in the hippocampus of rat brain. Hybridization was carried out using a radiolabeled antisense probe complementary to the rat liver GR gene. The specificity of the method was validated by showing: 1) a high cellular grain density in sections hybridized with an antisense but not a sense probe; 2) agreement between the experimental and theoretical temperature at which 50% of the hybrids melted, and 3) a high signal distribution of GR mRNA in the hippocampus, a region of brain known to preferentially concentrate steroid hormones. Within the hippocampus, however, subregional differences in hybridization densities were observed. Quantitative autoradiography indicated that the average neuronal silver grain number was highest in the pyramidal cell layers of CA2 and CA4 and lowest in those of CA1 and CA3. Also, there was a significant difference in the average grain number between all of the cell fields except for that between CA2 and CA4. These results show that contiguous but neuroanatomically distinct cell fields of the hippocampus express different levels of GR transcripts, and indicate that differential regulation of GR expression occurs in subpopulations of hippocampal neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"SCG10 is a nerve growth factor (NGF)-inducible, neuron-specific protein whose expression is tightly correlated with axonal and/or dendritic growth. We have recently shown that the mRNA encoding SCG10 is expressed at significant levels in certain subsets of neurons in the adult rat brain, while its expression is undetectable or negligible in other non-neuronal tissues. Here we show that regional SCG10 mRNA expression in the adult mouse brain is comparable to that in the rat, however, in the hippocampus its expression profile is distinct. In the mouse, SCG10 mRNA is expressed at high levels in pyramidal cells of CA3-CA4 sub-fields of Ammon's horn and at low levels in the CA1-CA2 sub-fields, while it is found rather uniformly throughout the pyramidal cell layer of the rat hippocampus. SCG10 mRNA is not detectable in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus, although it is expressed in the rat dentate gyrus. Comparison with other mRNAs encoding neuronal growth-associated proteins (nGAPs) such as GAP-43, MAP2, alpha 1-tubulin and stathmin suggests that dentate granule cells express a different repertoire of neuronal growth-associated genes in mouse and rat.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Injection of the antimitotic drug methylazoxymethanol (MAM) in the pregnant rat at E14 leads in the offsprings to a severe malformation with microcephaly and cortical heterotopiae in the white matter and in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. These animals suffer cognitive and epileptic disorders. Since these pathologies have been associated with glutamatergic transmission abnormalities, we have examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry the distribution and expression levels of several glutamate receptors subunits in these rats. Examination of the GluR2 flip and flop, NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunit gene transcripts showed a qualitatively similar distribution in both the neocortex and hippocampus of MAM and control rats. Quantitative analysis revealed an altered proportion of the GluR2 flip and flop subunits in the CA1 region of MAM animals as compared to controls. Moreover, a 26% reduction in the expression of the NR1 subunit and a 40% increase in the expression of the GluR2 flip subunit were noted in cortical heterotopiae, as compared to the adjacent neocortex. Immunostaining for GluR2/3, NR1 or NR2 showed, in both MAM and control animals, that glutamate receptors were mainly concentrated in the soma and dendrites of neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells, including in heterotopiae, and in the apical dendrites of hippocampal granule cells. Abnormalities in the expression of glutamate receptor subtypes in cortical heterotopiae and in the hippocampal CA1 region could contribute to functional disorders previously reported in MAM animals such as memory impairments and epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Global ischemia induces apoptosis-associated genes in hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Using in situ hybridization, Northern blotting and RT-PCR we studied the post-ischemic expression of bcl-2, bcl-x, bax and ICE. One day following 5 min or 10 min of global ischemia bcl-2 and bcl-x mRNAs were induced in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons while bax was unchanged. By 72 h after ischemia the expression of bcl-2, bcl-x and bax mRNAs decreased in CA1. The large isoform of bcl-x (bcl-xL), detected using RT-PCR, decreased in whole hippocampus by 24-72 h after ischemia relative to the putative short (bcl-xS) and transmembrane deleted (bcl-x delta TM) forms. Oligonucleotides to interleukin-1 beta convertase (ICE), which detected the expected 2-kb transcript and two lesser 1.5- and 3-kb hybridizing species, demonstrated slight mRNA induction in the CA1 region at 72 h following ischemia. DNA nick end-labeling at 3 days following ischemia showed DNA fragmentation in neurons limited to the CA1 region of hippocampus following 5 min ischemia, while DNA fragmentation was detected in CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus and cortical neurons following 10 min ischemia. The data support the view that hippocampal neurons might undergo an apoptosis-like death after global ischemia. Since global ischemia decreases total protein synthesis especially in the CA1 region, the increases in bcl-2 mRNA levels may not necessarily lead to increased Bcl-2 protein levels. This may explain why the CA1 neurons die despite the prominent induction of the protective bcl-2 gene. The observed decrease by 24 h in the bcl-xL/bcl-xS ratio which preceded DNA fragmentation may participate in the cell death produced by ischemia. However, because of the ischemia-induced decrease in total protein synthesis, the decreased bcl-xL/bcl-xS ratio does not necessarily lead to a changed ratio in the amount of the appropriate proteins. Since ICE-like mRNA was induced at 72 h when the CA1 neurons were dead, the significance of this ICE-like mRNA induction remains unclear.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Nitric oxide and glucocorticoids have been implicated in learning and memory, as well as in regulation of the stress response. By use of the in situ hybridization technique, we examined the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA in the hippocampus. In control animals, nitric oxide synthase subtype I (neuronal) messenger RNA was expressed in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Nitric oxide synthase subtype I expression was almost absent in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Neither subtype II (immunological) nor subtype III (endothelial) nitric oxide synthase messenger RNAs were observed in neurons of the hippocampal subfields. Bilateral removal of the adrenal glands resulted in a significant increase in nitric oxide synthase subtype I messenger RNA expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and in granular cells of the dentate gyrus. To a lesser degree, the nitric oxide synthase subtype I messenger RNA signal was increased in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Daily administration of glucocorticoids for one week attenuated the adrenalectomy-induced increased level of expression of the messenger RNA encoding nitric oxide synthase subtype I in all areas studied. Because adrenalectomy, which suppresses the production of glucocorticoids, increases nitric oxide synthase expression, and replacement of adrenalectomized animals with glucocorticoids restores the basal levels of nitric oxide synthase subtype I expression, our results demonstrate an up-regulation of nitric oxide synthase subtype I messenger RNA in the absence of glucocorticoids in the hippocampus. The present findings suggest an involvement of the stress axis in the regulation of the synaptic plasticity process mediated by nitric oxide in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The genes encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are all expressed in the adult rat hippocampus. The colocalization of the these factors with the receptors to which they bind, namely trkB, trkC and the bFGF receptor, respectively, suggests that in the hippocampus they may exert their putative protective and trophic effects through an autocrine mechanism. The morphology and survival of hippocampal neurons are also affected by glucocorticoids, which can act as transcriptional activators of gene expression. In this study we have used in situ hybridization to investigate the adrenal steroid regulation of the mRNAs encoding the neurotrophic factors BDNF, NT-3, and bFGF, their respective receptors, and the growth-associated protein GAP-43. After 7 days of adrenalectomy (ADX), there was an increase in the level of GAP-43 mRNA expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, that was prevented by corticosterone replacement to the ADX animals. In the CA2 subregion, adrenalectomy resulted in a decrease in bFGF mRNA expression, that was reversed by steroid treatment. There was evidence for glucocorticoid modulation of the BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs in pyramidal cell layers and in the dentate gyrus, but not of the mRNAs encoding the trkB, trk C or bFGF receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"A role for p53-mediated modulation of neuronal viability has been suggested by the finding that p53 expression is increased in damaged neurons in models of ischemia and epilepsy. P53 gene upregulation precedes apoptosis in many cell types, and a potential role for this molecule in apoptosis of neurons has already been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that p53-associated apoptosis may be a common mechanism of cell loss in several important neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we examined changes in p53-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the brains of aged rats for the first time employing immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization methods. P53-IR neurons were found in the CA1 region of hippocampus, septal region and cerebellum in the aged rats, but there was no p53-IR cell in the brains of adult rats. In the hippocampus of the aged rat, p53-IR cells predominated in the stratum oriens and pyramidal layers, while the molecular layer contained relatively few p53-IR cells. The most prominent population of immunoreactive labeling in cerebellar cortex was localised within the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and dendrites in molecular layers. Upregulation of p53 in the Purkinje cells observed in this study suggests that significant loss of Purkinje cells with aging may be regulated with several apoptosis-controlling factors including p53 and oxidative stress mechanism. Further investigations are required to establish whether direct functional relations exist between p53 and the apoptotic neuronal death in normal aging or Alzheimer brains.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Although originally cloned from rat brain, the P2X7 receptor has only recently been localized in neurones, and functional responses mediated by these neuronal P2X7 receptors (P2X7 R) are largely unknown. Here we studied the effect of P2X7 R activation on the release of neurotransmitters from superfused rat hippocampal slices. ATP (1-30 mm) and other ATP analogues elicited concentration-dependent [3 H]GABA outflow, with the following rank order of potency: benzoylbenzoylATP (BzATP) > ATP > ADP. PPADS, the non-selective P2-receptor antagonist (3-30 microm), Brilliant blue G (1-100 nm) the P2X7 -selective antagonist and Zn2+ (0.1-30 microm) inhibited, whereas lack of Mg2+ potentiated the response by ATP. In situ hybridization revealed that P2X7 R mRNA is expressed in the neurones of the cell body layers in the hippocampus. P2X7 R immunoreactivity was found in excitatory synaptic terminals in CA1 and CA3 region targeting the dendrites of pyramidal cells and parvalbumin labelled structures. ATP (3-30 microm) and BzATP (0.6-6 microm) elicited concentration-dependent [14 C]glutamate efflux, and blockade of the kainate receptor-mediated transmission by CNQX (10-100 microm) and gadolinium (100 microm), decreased ATP evoked [3 H]GABA efflux. The Na+ channel blocker TTX (1 microm), low temperature (12 degrees C), and the GABA uptake blocker nipecotic acid (1 mm) prevented ATP-induced [3 H]GABA efflux. Brilliant blue G and PPADS also reduced electrical field stimulation-induced [3 H]GABA efflux. In conclusion, P2X7 Rs are localized to the excitatory terminals in the hippocampus, and their activation regulates the release of glutamate and GABA from themselves and from their target cells.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Evidence for novel estrogen binding sites in the rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Estrogen modulates the morphology and physiology of the rat hippocampus and enhances cognitive function. While estrogen receptor (alpha and beta) messenger RNAs have been detected in the hippocampus, the presence of functional protein remains uncertain. The present study used a new radiolabeled estrogen, [125I]estrogen, and in vivo autoradiography to address this question. Nuclear uptake and retention of [125I]estrogen was detected in the pyramidal cells of CA1-CA3, with the majority of cells in the ventral horn of CA2 and CA3 being labeled. Additional labeled cells were scattered throughout the strata oriens and radiatum and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Since the number and distribution of labeled cells in the hippocampus was more than expected, in situ hybridization was used to assess the localization of estrogen receptor (alpha and beta) messenger RNAs in this brain region. The results revealed that both estrogen receptors are expressed in regions where [125I]estrogen binding was seen, although the intensity of estrogen receptor-alpha hybridization signal appears to be stronger when compared with estrogen receptor-beta.The results of these studies have demonstrated the presence of estrogen receptors in rat hippocampus and shown that the distribution of binding sites was much greater than expected, particularly in the pyramidal cells of the ventral hippocampus. These observations challenge our current thinking about steroid hormones and their mechanism(s) of action in a region associated with learning and memory and affected by the neurodegenerative conditions of aging.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cytochrome P4502E (P4502E), the major ethanol-inducible P450 metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde and bioactivates procarcinogens to ultimate carcinogens. Metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde in the brain could be deleterious since it can react with cytoskeletal proteins, forming adducts. In the present study, rats were administered ethanol chronically to evaluate its effect on chlorzoxazone hydroxylation in rat brain regions. Chlorzoxazone hydroxylation in brains from the treated rats was induced in hippocampus and cortex, downregulated in brainstem, and unchanged in cerebellum, striatum, and thalamus. The presence of functionally active P4502E was also seen in human brain regions obtained at autopsy from traffic accident victims. Northern blot analysis of rat and human brain poly(A)(+) RNA hybridized with cDNA to rat CYP2E1 revealed the constitutive presence of a corresponding transcript in rat and human brain. Localization of CYP2E by fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated the constitutive expression of CYP2E preferentially in the neuronal cells in rat and human brain. CYP2E expression was seen in neurons within the cerebral cortex, Purkinje and granule cell layers of cerebellum, granule cell layer of dentate gyrus, and pyramidal neurons of CA1, CA2, and CA3 subfields of hippocampus in both rat and human brain. The present studies demonstrate constitutive expression of P4502E1 in brain, its differential induction in rat brain regions by chronic ethanol treatment, and its topographic distribution in rat and human brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Na+K+ ATPase (Na+ pump) plays a central role in regulating cation homeostasis and is thought to have an important role in cell proliferation. The multitude of subunit isoforms comprising the functional Na+K+ ATPase has raised the possibility that specific subunit isoform combinations may be involved in different cellular processes. We have investigated the involvement of the specific isoforms in neurons and glia at the site of a CNS lesion. Intracerebroventricular injection of kainic acid was used to induce neuronal cell loss and reactive gliosis in rat hippocampus and levels of Na+K+ ATPase subunit isoform mRNA levels were determined in cells of rat hippocampus using in situ hybridization. alpha 2 mRNA levels increased 35-40% in CA1 and CA3 astrocytes between 1-3 weeks after KA injection with no significant change in other subunit isoform mRNA levels. In addition alpha 3 mRNA levels in CA1 pyramidal neurons were decreased by approx. 35%. Small neurons in the CA1 and CA3 region showed no changes in mRNA levels for any of the Na+K+ ATPase subunit isoforms. These results may indicate a possible role for alpha 2 subunit isoform in the conversion of glial cells from a normal phenotype to the reactive phenotype characteristic in this model of CNS injury.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The novel long PDE4A10 cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase shows a pattern of expression within brain that is distinct from the long PDE4A5 and short PDE4A1 isoforms.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridisation methods were used to map the distribution of the novel long PDE4A10 isoform in the brain. PDE4A10 distribution was compared to that of the long PDE4A5 isoform and the short PDE4A1 isoform using probes specific for unique sequences within each of these isoforms. Coronal sections of the brain, taken at the level of the olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum, were analysed. Strongest expression of PDE4A isoforms was found in the olfactory bulb granular layer with high signals also in the piriform cortex, the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cells. For the two long forms, level general staining was noted throughout the striatum, thalamus and hippocampus but no signal was evident in the cerebellum. The long PDE4A10 and PDE4A5 isoforms localised to essentially the same regions throughout the brain, although PDE4A10 was uniquely expressed in the major island of Calleja. A signal for the short PDE4A1 isoform was found in regions in which the two long isoforms were both expressed, with the exception of the medial nucleus of the amygdala where weak signals for PDE4A5 and PDE4A10 were detected but PDE4A1 was absent. Uniquely, strong signals for PDE4A1 were detected in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the CA3 pyramidal cell region and the cerebellum; areas where signals for the two long forms were not evident. PDE4A transcripts for both PDE4A5 and PDE4A10 were not apparent in the brain stem and those for PDE4A1 were low. PDE4A isoforms are present in several key areas of the brain and therefore present valid targets for therapeutic interventions. Whilst the two long PDE4A isoforms show a remarkably similar distribution, in at least three regions there is clear segregation between their pattern of expression and that of the PDE4A1 short form. This identifies differential regulation of the expression of PDE4A long and short isoforms. We suggest that specific PDE4A isoforms may have distinct functional roles in the brain, indicating that PDE4A isoform-selective inhibitors may have specific therapeutic and pharmacologic properties.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The immunophilin homolog FKBP8 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. Here we show that the 38-kDa form of FKBP8 (FKBP38) derives from a truncated ORF. The extended FKBP8 ORFs are 46 and 44 kDa in mouse and 45 kDa in human. Although the genomic organization of mouse and human FKBP8 is evolutionarily conserved, additional first exons are encoded by the murine locus. A 4.4-kb murine Fkbp8 gene fragment, containing a GC-rich potential promoter, directed expression of a LacZ reporter gene to forebrain neurons in transgenic mice. Expression of the transgene was observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in transgenic mice from three lines. One transgenic founder mouse exhibited widespread forebrain expression of the LacZ transgene that resembles the pattern for the endogenous Fkbp8 gene. Thus promoter/enhancer elements for forebrain expression are located around the first exons of the mouse Fkbp8 gene.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine can control neuritogenesis of hippocampal cells. The timing of its receptors expression consequently may influence synaptogenesis and neuronal activity in the developing hippocampus. We investigated the mRNA expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine-gated ion channel receptor (nAChR) alpha 4 subunit in the embryonic and postnatal hippocampal formation. Although its expression level is low in the adult hippocampus, this protein constitutes the major nAChR subunit in the central nervous system. We carried out in-situ hybridization experiments to determine whether or not the alpha 4 AChR subunit mRNA distributions show evidence of regional and developmental regulation during hippocampal maturation. Our studies reveal that alpha 4 AChR mRNA expression was low at the embryonic stage, but increased transiently during postnatal development reaching a maximum during the second week of life and decreasing thereafter, to a minimum at adulthood. In hippocampal regions, the peak values of alpha 4 AChR expression were between 400 and 800% of adult alpha 4 messenger levels. In the postnatal hippocampus, most of the cells from the pyramidal layer of the CA3 and CA2 areas displayed a strong hybridization signal for the alpha 4 AChR subunit. In the hilus and the CA1 regions, the localization of the alpha 4 transcripts seemed to be restricted to some interneurons and pyramidal cells, respectively. Moderate and uniform in-situ hybridization signals were observed in granular cells from the dentate gyrus. The transient profile of alpha 4 expression suggests that nAChRs may participate in the early postnatal maturation of hippocampal circuity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The aim of the study was to compare the localization of the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway in hippocampus of mice and rats using cGMP- and soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization of the cGMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase types 2, 5 and 9. In vitro incubation of hippocampus slices in the absence of a guanylyl cyclase stimulator or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor resulted in cGMP-positive astrocytes mainly in the CA1 area in mouse slices. In contrast, no cGMP immunoreactivity was observed under these conditions in the rat hippocampus. Treatment with an NO synthase inhibitor or inhibitors of soluble or particulate GC did not abolish cGMP immunoreactivity in astrocytes. Incubation with the NO donors sodium nitroprusside or diethylamino NONOate, or with the NO-independent activators of soluble GC, YC-1 and BAY 41-2272, in combination with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, resulted in an increase in cGMP immunoreactivity in numerous astrocytes throughout the mouse hippocampus. In contrast, under these conditions cGMP immunoreactivity was primarily observed in varicose fibers in rat hippocampus. Comparison of the cellular localization of the beta1 subunit of soluble GC and the mRNAs of PDE2, PDE5 and PDE9 revealed that in both species the beta1 subunit was observed in pyramidal and granule cells, which also expressed the mRNAs of the three phosphodiesterase families. Although the beta1 subunit was observed in astrocytes, none of the phosphodiesterases were detected in these cells. We conclude that, although the expression profiles of the soluble GC beta1 subunit and cGMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase mRNAs were identical, the cellular patterns of cGMP immunoreactivity differ between rat and mouse hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Levels of mRNAs encoding the proto-oncogene, c-fos, and the 70 kDa stress protein, hsp70, were evaluated in gerbil brain following transient cerebral ischemia of varied duration by in situ and blot hybridization techniques. Blots of total hippocampal RNA obtained after 5 min ischemic insults confirmed a characteristic, transient time course of c-fos expression with a striking elevation within 1 h and a return to control levels by 3 h recirculation. Hsp70 hybridization was significant at 1 h and continued to increase until 3-6 h after the insult. Striking accumulation of c-fos mRNA was detected within 15 min recirculation in dentate granule cells, persisting through 1 h, and a weaker signal was evident in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus, as well as in prepiriform/entorhinal cortex and neocortical regions, during the same interval. Hsp70 hybridization showed an identical distribution at 1 h recirculation. Ischemic insults of 1 min duration resulted in no detectable increase of either mRNA, while 2 min ischemia resulted in changes comparable to those seen after 5 min insults. This common threshold corresponds to the ischemic interval required for energy depletion and resultant failure of intracellular ion homeostasis. In contrast, expression of hsp70 mRNA was not observed under conditions of brief depolarization accompanying cortical or hippocampal spreading depression that were shown to induce c-fos. A delayed component of c-fos mRNA expression was not detected in this model, while persistent hsp70 hybridization, restricted to hippocampal CA1 neurons, was evident at 48 h after either 2 min or 5 min ischemic insults. The parallels in c-fos and hsp70 mRNA expression during early recirculation suggest that overlapping mechanisms triggered following postischemic depolarization contribute to their induction after transient ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampal calmodulin (CaM) gene expression was determined in the rat after transient forebrain ischemia. Ischemia was induced by the 4-vessel occlusion model, and the hybridized mRNA copy numbers corresponding to the 3 CaM genes detected by phosphorimaging were determined by quantitative in situ hybridization 24 h post-insult. A small, but significant upregulation (by 8.8%) of the CaM I gene was observed in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, whereas other regions exhibited a maintained or slightly decreased CaM gene expression. The CaM mRNA levels decreased most markedly (by 10-15%) in the hippocampal molecular layers. No consistent correlation was found between the ischemic vulnerability and the CaM gene expression pattern. The results indicate that the induction of delayed neuronal death is not incidental to the transcriptional activation of the CaM genes in the ischemic rat hippocampus in vivo. As the calcium-bound CaM content increases during the ischemic insult, downregulation of the CaM gene expression could be a homeostatic response aimed at maintaining the intracellular level of the active CaM pool.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The present study addresses mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor effects on hippocampal neuron viability after experimental traumatic brain injury. Rats were pretreated for 48 h with vehicle, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone, or the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone (RU486) and subsequently subjected to sham operation or unilateral controlled cortical impact injury. To determine the effects of receptor antagonist pretreatments on cell survival, neurons in regions CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation were counted 24 h post-injury using the optical fractionator method. Injury decreased the number of viable neurons in CA1 and CA3 of vehicle-pretreated animals. Notably, this cell loss was prevented in CA1 by RU486 pretreatment. Neuronal loss was also observed in dentate gyrus. The effects of receptor blockade and injury on the expression of viability-related genes were also assessed by comparing relative bcl-2, bax, and p53 messenger RNA levels using in situ hybridization analysis. Spironolactone and RU486 decreased basal bcl-2 messenger RNA levels in CA1 and dentate gyrus but did not affect basal bax or p53 levels. Injury decreased bcl-2 messenger RNA levels in dentate gyrus but did not affect bax or p53 levels in vehicle-pretreated animals. These data demonstrate that RU486 pretreatment prevents the loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons 24 h after traumatic brain injury. RU486 modulation of bcl-2, bax, or p53 messenger RNA expression does not predict neuronal viability at this time point, suggesting that RU486-mediated preservation of CA1 neurons does not involve transcriptional regulation of these cell death-related genes.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Electroconvulsive stimuli enhance both neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 and Y2 messenger RNA expression and levels of binding in the rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Repeated electroconvulsive stimulations and other seizure modalities produce an increase in neuropeptide Y synthesis and local release in the rat hippocampus, and perhaps as a consequence, a change in the concentration of neuropeptide Y binding sites in the same region. The aim of the present study was to determine possible changes in the expression of neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes affected by repeated stimulations in the hippocampus. Rats were exposed to 14 daily stimulations, and the brains were removed 24h after the last stimulation. For in vitro receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridisation histochemistry, the brains were frozen, sectioned, and levels of neuropeptide Y binding sites and messenger RNA expressions were determined quantitatively on sections from the same animals. In order to determine the contribution of different neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes, serial sections were incubated with either 125I-labelled peptide YY alone or the same radio-labelled peptide mixed with an excess of a number of displacing compounds with affinity for either neuropeptide Y receptor subtype Y1, Y2, or both. Binding studies revealed that the majority of peptide YY binding sites was represented by Y2, and that electroconvulsive stimulations reduced the binding capacity or the concentration of this receptor. A prominent reduction of Y1-preferring binding sites was determined in the dentate gyrus, and to a lesser extent in the CA1 and CA3 regions. Similarly, the treatment produced a significant reduction of Y2-preferring binding sites in the CA1 and CA3 region, but not in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Using semi-quantitative in situ hybridization, Y1 receptor messenger RNA level in the granular cell layer of the dentate increased by the stimulations. In the same region, Y2 receptor messenger RNA was expressed in low to undetectable amounts, but after the repeated stimulations, this transcript was found in moderate to high levels. These data suggest that the neuropeptide Yergic system in the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer are affected by the treatment, and that this includes both Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes. Because levels of messenger RNA and binding are distinctly regulated, the turnover of both Y1 and Y2 molecules is strongly increased under electroconvulsive stimulations, suggesting that the intrahippocampal neuropeptide Yergic neurotransmission is also increased under the stimulations.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Down-regulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis in corticolimbic circuits mediates social isolation-induced behavior in mice.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Allopregnanolone (ALLO), synthesized by pyramidal neurons, is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the action of GABA at GABA(A) receptors expressing specific neurosteroid binding sites. In the brain, ALLO is synthesized from progesterone by the sequential action of two enzymes: 5alpha-reductase type I (5alpha-RI) and 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD). In the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, these enzymes are colocalized in principal glutamatergic output neurons [Agís-Balboa RC, Pinna G, Zhubi A, Maloku E, Veldic M, Costa E, Guidotti A (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:14602-14607], but they are not detectable in GABAergic interneurons. Using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, this study compares 5alpha-RI and 3alpha-HSD mRNA brain expression levels in group housed and in socially isolated male mice for 4 weeks. In these socially isolated mice, the mRNA expression of 5alpha-RI was dramatically decreased in hippocampal CA3 glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, dentate gyrus granule cells, glutamatergic neurons of the basolateral amygdala, and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons of layer V/VI frontal (prelimbic, infralimbic) cortex (FC). In contrast, 5alpha-RI mRNA expression failed to change in CA1 pyramidal neurons, central amygdala neurons, pyramidal neurons of layer II/III FC, ventromedial thalamic nucleus neurons, and striatal medium spiny and reticular thalamic nucleus neurons. Importantly, 3alpha-HSD mRNA expression was unchanged by protracted social isolation (Si). These data suggest that, in male mice, after 4 weeks of Si, the expression of 5alpha-RI mRNA, which is the rate-limiting-step enzyme of ALLO biosynthesis, is specifically down-regulated in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons that converge on the amygdala from cortical and hippocampal regions. In socially isolated mice, this down-regulation may account for the appearance of behavioral disorders such as anxiety, aggression, and cognitive dysfunction.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of the genes encoding the alpha subunit of type-II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAM-KII alpha) and the gamma subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC gamma) was examined throughout postnatal rat brain development by in situ hybridization histochemistry. CAM-KII alpha was found to be expressed sequentially over the different hippocampal subregions, beginning with expression in the pyramidal cells of CA3 at birth, followed by expression in the external blade of the dentate gyrus and in CA1 on postnatal day (PND) 5 and, finally, on PND 8 in the internal blade of the dentate gyrus. PKC gamma expression, in contrast, rose simultaneously in the hippocampal subregions CA1 and CA3, with little expression over the dentate gyrus. This fashion of expression corresponds to the similar maturational state of the pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3, whereas CAM-KII alpha expression during development of the rat hippocampus follows the time table of afferent lamination, which is delayed in CA1 compared to CA3. Furthermore, we found a temporal overexpression of CAM-KII alpha in the hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 at the end of the second postnatal week which coincides with the development of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor binding.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Age-related changes in the expression of Na, K-ATPase alpha1- and alpha3-isoform mRNAs were analyzed by in situ hybridization in the Fischer-344 rat hippocampus. Quantification of signal density with cRNA probes in rat hippocampus at 3 months of age showed (a) alpha1 content is 1.5 times higher in granule than in pyramidal cell layers, whereas alpha3 content shows the opposite ratio and (b) alpha3 label is found in large clusters related to mossy cells and basket cells and in medium clusters corresponding to interneurons within the dendritic fields of CA1-3. In the 24-month-old rats as compared with the young animals, the alpha1 signal is increased more than sevenfold in the dendritic fields and is not significantly changed in the perikaryal layers. The alpha3 signal is reduced about threefold (p<0.0001, ANOVA, n=6) in perikaryal layers, is almost completely absent over interneurons, basket cells, and mossy cells, and is not significantly changed in dendritic fields. These data indicate age-related, cell- and isoform-specific alterations in pretranslational regulation of Na,K-ATPase a isoforms. The striking changes in the dendritic fields, mossy cells, and GABAergic basket cells and interneurons may constitute early and sensitive markers for age related alterations in hippocampal function, before cell loss.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Severe, transient global ischemia of the brain induces delayed damage to specific neuronal populations. Sustained Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptor channels is thought to play a critical role in postischemic cell death. Although most kainate-type glutamate receptors are Ca(2+)-impermeable, Ca(2+)-permeable kainate receptors have been reported in specific kinds of neurons and glia. Recombinant receptors assembled from GluR1 and/or GluR3 subunits in exogenous expression systems are permeable to Ca2+; heteromeric channels containing GluR2 subunits are Ca(2+)-impermeable. Thus, altered expression of GluR2 in development or following a neurological insult or injury to the brain can act as a switch to modify Ca2+ permeability. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying delayed postischemic cell death, GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 gene expression was examined by in situ hybridization in postischemic rats. Following severe, transient forebrain ischemia GluR2 gene expression was preferentially reduced in CA1 hippocampal neurons at a time point that preceded their degeneration. The switch in expression of kainate/AMPA receptor subunits coincided with the previously reported increase in Ca2+ influx into CA1 cells. Timing of the switch indicates that it may play a causal role in postischemic cell death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'GABAA receptor alpha 1, beta 3 and gamma 2 subunit mRNA levels have been measured in hippocampus using in situ hybridization, following 1, 10 and 40 seizures produced by rapid kindling stimulations. Major alterations of gene expression were largely confined to the dentate gyrus. One stimulus-induced seizure reduced gamma 2 mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus by 30%. In contrast, mRNA expression increased for alpha 1 in CA1 and CA3 and for beta 3 in CA1 to around 30% above control values. Ten stimulations reduced beta 3 (by 19%) and gamma 2 (by 37%) mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus. No changes were observed in other hippocampal subregions. Forty kindling-induced seizures led to biphasic alterations of subunit mRNA levels in dentate gyrus with only minor changes in CA1-CA3. Up to 4 h after the last seizure mRNA expression for alpha 1 was slightly decreased in dentate gyrus, whereas marked reductions were observed for beta 3 and gamma 2 (by 41% and 48%, respectively). Between 12 and 48 h there were major increases of alpha 1 (by 59%) and gamma 2 (by 35%) mRNA levels but no significant changes of beta 3 mRNA expression. Subunit mRNA levels had returned to control values after 5 days, which argues against a direct involvement of GABAA receptor in kindling-evoked hyperexcitability. The rapid and transient, biphasic changes of GABAA receptor subunits following recurrent seizures could play an important role in stabilizing granule cell excitability, thereby reducing seizure susceptibility. The differential regulation of subunit mRNA levels following seizures suggests a novel mechanism for changing the physiological properties of dentate granule cells through possible GABAA receptor complexes with different subunit composition.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ingestion of trimethyltin (TMT) produces mental confusion and temporal lobe seizures in humans. In rats, it causes increased seizure susceptibility, hyperactivity, aggression, learning impairment, and neuronal loss especially of hippocampal CA3c pyramidal cells and in the piriform cortex. As some of these symptoms may be due to impaired inhibitory neurotransmission, mRNA levels of the nine major GABA(A) receptor subunits, of GABA(B) receptors 1 and 2, and the 65- and 67-kD glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) variants were investigated by in situ hybridization 2, 5, and 16 days after TMT administration. GAD-65 mRNA levels were enhanced in hippocampal interneurons by up to 46% 5 days after TMT application, suggesting increased activity of respective neurons. In the granule cell layer, only the GABA(A) receptor subunit delta mRNA was altered (decreased by 48%). In the hippocampal sector CA3c and in the piriform cortex, mRNA levels of GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha1, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma2 and of both GABA(B) receptors declined (by 46-72%) after 5-16 days, being consistent with the extensive cell loss. In contrast, subunit alpha2 mRNA levels decreased already after 2 days at an extent exceeding the cell loss in CA3. Subunit alpha4 mRNA levels increased (about two-fold) in surviving CA3 neurons. In sector CA1, mRNA levels of subunits alpha1, alpha5, beta2, beta3, and gamma2 decreased by 35-54% in spite of only a minor (9%) cell loss. The data indicate neurodegeneration related decreases in mRNA levels in sector CA3 and piriform cortex, whereas decreases in sector CA1 may be a consequence of impaired excitatory input to this area.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Androgens selectively modulate C-fos messenger RNA induction in the rat hippocampus following novelty.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously shown that androgen receptors are found in high concentrations in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. To begin to explore the possible roles for androgen receptors in this area of the brain, we studied the effects of endogenous and exogenous androgen on the behaviourally induced expression of cellular immediate early gene messenger RNAs. Adult male Fischer 344 rats were either gonadectomized, gonadectomized and given two Silastic capsules of dihydrotestosterone propionate at the time of surgery, or left intact. Three weeks later, animals were placed into a novel open field for 20 min. This behavioural paradigm caused region- and gene-specific increases of c-fos, jun-B, c-jun and zif268 messenger RNA in the hippocampus as determined by semi-quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry. The removal of circulating androgen by gonadectomy potentiated, whereas dihydrotestosterone treatment of castrates attenuated, the behaviourally induced expression of c-fos messenger RNA in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. No changes in c-fos messenger RNA expression were detected in the CA3 or dentate gyrus regions where androgen receptor levels are low. Androgen status did not affect either the basal or stimulated expression of Jun-B, c-Jun or zif268 messenger RNA in any of the three cellular regions of the hippocampus examined. These results implicate androgen receptors in modulating the active response of hippocampal neurons to a behaviourally relevant stimulus. Since the products of cellular immediate genes can function to alter an array of downstream genes, the modulation of these genes in the hippocampus by gonadal hormones may have important ramifications for hippocampal function.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques were used for investigating changes in cholecystokinin immunoreactivity and mRNA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus after kainic acid-induced limbic seizures in the rat. Marked increases in cholecystokinin mRNA concentrations were observed in layers II/III and V/VI of the cerebral cortex, in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, and in presumptive basket cells of the dentate gyrus 1 and 2 days after the acute seizures. Whereas cholecystokinin mRNA contents returned to normal in the cerebral cortex and the CA1 sector at later intervals, high concentrations were observed in basket cells even 2 months after the initial seizures. Accordingly, cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity was intensified in the cerebral cortex, CA1 sector and in presumed basket cells of the hippocampus 30 days after kainic acid. Besides its high content in basket cells, cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity was primarily present in neuronal fibers or diffusely distributed in the respective brain area. In the hippocampus, strongly enhanced staining for cholecystokinin was also observed in the alveus, the stratum lacunosum moleculare, and in the inner molecular layer, suggesting increased concentrations of the peptide in afferent and efferent fibers of the hippocampus. The present experiments suggest a strong activation of cholecystokinin systems in the brain after kainic acid-induced limbic seizures in the rat. This is indicated by pronounced increases in cholecystokinin mRNA in the cortex and individual cell types of the hippocampus (basket cells, granule cells, and CA1 pyramidal neurons). The subsequent increases in cholecystokin immunoreactivity even surpass those in mRNA. The observed changes may be part of the self-defense mechanisms that protect the animals during subsequent epileptic episodes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pyramidal neurons of the adult and fetal hippocampus and subicular fields were shown to express D2 mRNA using non-radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry. At the earliest developmental stages examined (embryonic week (E) 13), cell packing within the CA1 region is dense and immature neuroblasts express D2 mRNA at high levels, as do more mature pyramid-like neurons in the deep aspect of the pyramidal cell layer. With development (E19 and E24), cell packing density is reduced, maturing neurons of the pyramidal layer are prominently D2 mRNA positive, while the majority of immature cells lining the superficial layer are D2 mRNA negative. In Layer II of the presubiculum there is a high density of immature D2 mRNA negative cells at E13 with D2 mRNA positive cells located on the periphery of the clusters. By E24, the cells in the layer II clusters are larger, express D2 mRNA, and D2 mRNA negative cells are rarely observed. Thus, expression of D2 mRNA in humans is an early and permanent feature of pyramidal neurons of these regions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The cellular mechanisms responsible for synaptic plasticity involve interactions between neurons and the extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfates (HSs) constitute a group of glycosaminoglycans that accumulate in the beta-amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease and influence the development of neuron-target contacts by interacting with other cell surface and matrix molecules. However, the contribution of HSs to brain function is unknown. We found that HSs play a crucial role in long-term potentiation (LTP), a finding that is consistent with the idea that converging molecular mechanisms are used in the development of neuron-target contacts and in activity-induced synaptic plasticity in adults. Enzymatic cleavage of HS by heparitinase as well as addition of soluble heparin-type carbohydrates prevented expression of LTP in response to 100 Hz/1 sec stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in rat hippocampal slices. A prominent carrier protein for the type of glycans implicated in LTP regulation in the adult hippocampus was identified as N-syndecan (syndecan-3), a transmembrane proteoglycan that was expressed at the processes of the CA1 pyramidal neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Addition of soluble N-syndecan into the CA1 dendritic area prevented tetanus-induced LTP. A major substrate of src-type kinases, cortactin (p80/85), and the tyrosine kinase fyn copurified with N-syndecan from hippocampus. Moreover, association of both cortactin and fyn to N-syndecan was rapidly increased after induction of LTP. N-syndecan may thus act as an important regulator in the activity-dependent modulation of neuronal connectivity by transmitting signals between extracellular heparin-binding factors and the fyn signaling pathway.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is Ca2+-dependent, yet little is known about the Ca2+ channel contributions that might direct selective expression of the multiple BDNF transcripts. Here, effects of pilocarpine-induced seizure activity on total BDNF expression and on the individual sensitivity of BDNF transcripts to glutamate receptor and Ca2+ channel blockers were evaluated using hippocampal slice cultures and in situ hybridization of transcript-specific cRNA probes directed against mRNAs for the four 5' exons (I-IV) of the BDNF gene. mRNAs for nerve growth factor (NGF) and tyrosine kinase B (trkB) also were studied. Pilocarpine (5 mM) induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in total BDNF (exon V) mRNA expression in the dentate granule cells and CA3-CA1 pyramidal cells with maximal effects at 6 and 24 h, respectively. Increases were blocked by co-treatment with the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid/kainate 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX: 25 microM) and the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; 25 microM), whereas the L-type voltage sensitive Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (20 microM) was without detectable effect. Maximal NGF and trkB mRNA expression was induced by pilocarpine at 4 and 12 h, respectively. For the individual BDNF transcripts, APV blocked pilocarpine-induced increases in transcript II, whereas nifedipine blocked increases in transcripts I and III. Transcript IV levels were not altered by treatment. These results indicate that transcript II makes the greatest contribution to pilocarpine effects on total BDNF mRNA content in this model and provides evidence for regional and Ca2+ channel-specific differences in activity-dependent regulation of the different BDNF transcripts in hippocampus.\",\n",

This large increase in cAMP levels results in release of cAMP or a cAMP metabolite and depression of synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapse through activation of A1 adenosine receptors. 2. Consistent with these studies, we report that antagonists of group II mGluRs block both the potentiation of cAMP accumulation elicited by activation of mGluRs and the depression of synaptic transmission induced by coactivation of mGluRs and beta-adrenergic receptors. 3. In situ hybridization studies suggest that of the cloned group II mGluRs only mGluR-3 mRNA is present in area CA1. Interestingly, mGluR-3 appears to be present predominantly in glia in this region. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that mGluRs coupled to potentiation of cAMP accumulation were present on glia rather than neurons in area CA1. 4. The selective group II mGluR agonist 2S,1'R,2'R,3'R-2(2,3-dicarboxycyclo-propyl)glycine (DCG-IV) failed to enhance cAMP-mediated electrophysiological responses to the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoprenaline (Iso) in CA1 pyramidal cells, suggesting that mGluRs coupled to potentiation of cAMP accumulation may not be present in these cells. 5. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with either of the selective glial toxins L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AA) or fluorocitrate (FC) blocked mGluR-mediated potentiation of cAMP accumulation. However, L-AA and FC had no discernible effects on viability of CA1 pyramidal cells, or cAMP-mediated electrophysiological effects in these neurons. 6. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with the neurotoxin kainate resulted in disruption of neuronal transmission and degeneration of neurons in area CA1, but had no effect on mGluR-mediated potentiation of cAMP accumulation. 7. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with the cAMP/cAMP metabolite transport blocker probenicid blocked the depression of synaptic transmission elicited by coapplication of Iso and DCG-IV, while having no significant effect on cAMP accumulation elicited by these agonists. 8. Taken together, these data suggest that mGluRs coupled to potentiation of cAMP accumulation are present on glia rather than neurons in area CA1 of hippocampus. This suggests that a novel form of glial-neuronal communication may exist, since activation of these mGluRs in concert with beta-adrenergic receptors results in depression of synaptic transmission.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Several mRNAs which encode for isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (PMCA) are present in adult rat brain. Using in situ hybridization with antisense oligonucleotide probes we found complex patterns of specific hybridization for three isoforms (PMCA1-3). Each rat brain region studied exhibited a distinct pattern of expression of isoforms. PMCA1 mRNA, which is widely distributed in rat tissues, was highest in CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus and very low in hypothalamic nuclei, cerebellum and choroid plexus. PMCA2 mRNA was highest in Purkinje cells of cerebellum and low in caudate-putamen, hypothalamic nuclei, habenula and choroid plexus. The highest levels of PMCA3 mRNA were found in habenula and choroid plexus. The PMCA1-3 isoforms appeared to be expressed primarily in neurons since hybridization was detected neither in white matter nor in regions rich in astrocytes. In different regions, different levels of expression of each PMCA mRNA may underlie specialized requirements for calcium homeostasis in specific neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'An ischemia-induced gene was screened using a differential display technique in mouse transient forebrain ischemia. One of the ischemia-responsive clones was found to encode mouse hsp40. HSP40 has a critical regulatory function in the HSC70 ATPase activity. Expression of hsp40 mRNA was low in the nonischemic mouse hippocampus, but it was significantly upregulated 4 hr after ischemia by Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization analysis revealed hsp40 mRNA induction in the neuron. HSP40 protein expression was also enhanced in the pyramidal and dentate granular neurons from 2 to 4 days after ischemia. The temporal expression and distribution profile of HSC70 protein was similar to that of HSP40, and both proteins were colocalized in ischemic hippocampal neurons. In the gerbil transient forebrain ischemia model, both HSP40 and HSC70 proteins were expressed strongly in ischemia-resistant CA3 neurons and dentate granule cells 1 day after 5 min ischemia, but were not expressed in vulnerable CA1 neurons. However, both proteins were in parallel expressed in the tolerance-acquired CA1 neurons. Based on the current observation that both HSP40 and HSC70 proteins were synergistically expressed in the ischemia-resistant and tolerance-acquired neurons, cochaperone HSP40 may play a significant role against postischemic neuronal response and lead to cell survival through interaction with simultaneously induced HSC70.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Developmental regulation and cell-specific expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor splice variants in rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"The present study demonstrates cell-specific and developmental regulation of 5' and 3' splicing of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR1 subunit within specific neuronal populations of the hippocampus. At birth, NR1 transcripts lacking exon 5 (encoding the amino-terminal splice cassette N1) exhibit mature patterns of labelling within the hippocampus, with high levels of expression in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus. In contrast, exon 5-containing (NR1(1XX)) transcripts are expressed at low levels until P8, at which time expression is prominent and essentially uniform in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus. Exon 5 expression increases at a faster rate in CA3 than in CA1 or dentate gyrus. By the third week postnatal (postnatal day P21), exon 5-containing transcripts exhibit a distinct gradient of labelling, with more intense expression in CA3, than in CA1 or dentate gyrus. By P21 pyramidal neurons of the CA1 and granule cells of the dentate gyrus express mainly NR1(0XX) receptor messenger RNAs (lacking exon 5). Because splicing in of the N1 splice cassette confers greater current amplitude and enhanced potentiation by protein kinase C, these observations predict elevated levels of synaptic activity in the CA1 early in postnatal life, a time at which synaptic plasticity is enhanced. The carboxy-terminal splice cassettes C1 and C2 are regulated independently within the hippocampus. Whereas NR1(X11) (C1-, C2-containing) and NR1(X01) (C2 only) receptors exhibit high levels of expression in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus, NR1(X00) receptors are expressed more intensely in pyramidal neurons of CA3. NR1(X10) receptor expression is very low in all cells and at all times examined, even in adults. Because splicing in of the C1 cassette is thought to regulate receptor targeting, clustering, and cytoskeletal interactions, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the two hippocampal subfields may play differing roles in synaptogenesis and the formation of new neuronal contacts. Moreover, cell-specific patterns of NR1(X11) receptor messenger RNAs parallel those of NR1(0XX) receptor messenger RNAs; and cell-specific patterns of NR1(1XX) (N1-containing) receptor messenger RNAs parallels those of NR1(X00) (C1-, C2-lacking) receptor messenger RNAs throughout development. These observations suggest that NR1(100) receptors, which exhibits the greatest potentiation by protein kinase C, are likely to be important in CA1 during the second and third weeks postnatal. Cell-specific expression of NR1 splice variants undoubtedly contributes to functional diversity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor properties in neuronal populations within the hippocampus. Developmental regulation of NR1 splicing is likely to influence synaptic plasticity and the formation of new synaptic contacts. Moreover, findings from this study suggest that a change in NR1 splicing following a neurological injury could significantly alter glutamate pathogenicity in a particular population of cells.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential expressions of glycine transporter 1 and three glutamate transporter mRNA in the hippocampus of gerbils with transient forebrain ischemia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The extracellular concentrations of glutamate and its co-agonist for the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, glycine, may be under the control of amino acid transporters in the ischemic brain. However, there is little information on changes in glycine and glutamate transporters in the hippocampal CA1 field of gerbils with transient forebrain ischemia. This study investigated the spatial and temporal expressions of glycine transporter 1 (GLYT1) and three glutamate transporter (excitatory amino acid carrier 1, EAAC1; glutamate/aspartate transporter, GLAST; glutamate transporter 1, GLT1) mRNA in the gerbil hippocampus after 3 minutes of ischemia. The GLYT1 mRNA was transiently upregulated by the second day after ischemia in astrocytelike cells in close vicinity to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, possibly to reduce glycine concentration in the local extracellular spaces. The EAAC1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in almost all pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells in the control gerbil hippocampus, whereas the expression level in CA1 pyramidal neurons started to decrease by the fourth day after ischemia in synchrony with degeneration of the CA1 neurons. The GLAST and GLT1 mRNA were rather intensely expressed in the dentate gyrus and CA3 field of the control hippocampus, respectively, but they were weakly expressed in the CA1 field before and after ischemia. As GLAST and GLT1 play a major role in the control of extracellular glutamate concentration, the paucity of these transporters in the CA1 field may account for the vulnerability of CA1 neurons to ischemia, provided that the functional GLAST and GLT1 proteins are also less in the CA1 field than in the CA3 field. This study suggests that the amino acid transporters play pivotal roles in the process of delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 field.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Heparin-binding growth-associated molecule is a potent neurotrophic factor. To obtain a better understanding of its role in the central nervous system, we studied the changes of its expression in adult rat brain after two types of neuronal injury. In the control hippocampus, expression of heparin-binding growth-associated molecule messenger RNA was confined to CA1 pyramidal neurons and some hilar cells. Following transient forebrain ischaemia, the messenger RNA expression decreased within the first two days. On day 4, however, both the messenger RNA level and the number of expression-positive cells markedly increased in the CA1 subfield, where the selective neuronal losses were seen following ischaemia. Double-staining with a heparin-binding growth-associated molecule complementary RNA probe and an anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody revealed that most of the expressing cells were reactive astrocytes. Moreover, the protein induction of heparin-binding growth-associated molecule after neuronal injury was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry using the affinity-purified antibodies. This molecule was also induced after intraventricular kainate injection, which is known to cause selective pyramidal cell necrosis in the CA3 region. Four days after the insult, the number of cells expressing the messenger RNA prominently increased in the CA3 subfield ipsilateral to the injection. As observed after the ischaemic insult, most of the expression-positive cells were identified as astrocytes. The data presented here suggest that heparin-binding growth-associated molecule, produced by the reactive astrocytes, may play important roles in the repair process after neuronal injury.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Transient expression of GAP-43 within the hippocampus after global brain ischemia in rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Neuroanatomical methods have been used to study selective vulnerability after global brain ischemia. A consistent pattern of ischemic neuronal damage is found in the rodent hippocampus with loss of CA1 neurons and of some cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Very little is known about plastic changes that would be expected in ischemia-resistant areas such as CA3 neurons and granule cells. Neuronal plasticity after lesions may be indicated by changes in labeling with antibodies to the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43). Expression of GAP-43 as a marker for neuronal plasticity was studied here in the hippocampus after global brain ischemia. Halothane-anesthetized rats were subjected to 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia using four-vessel occlusion. In situ hybridization was used to study GAP-43 mRNA at 1, 3, 6, and 12 h and at 1, 3, and 7 days after ischemia. Immunostaining was carried out with two different antibodies to GAP-43 in brains which were perfusion-fixed after 1, 2, 4, and 7/8 days. In the control hippocampus, GAP-43 mRNA was localized to CA1-CA3 and the hilus. Moderate increases in cellular signals were seen in hilar cells and granule cells early after ischemia, and some changes occurred in CA3 at late stages. Hybridization was lost in CA1 due to cell death. With immunostaining, GAP-43 was not seen in the cytoplasm of neurons, whereas dense labeling occurred in a differentiated pattern in the axonal and dendritic layers. At 1 day after ischemia, neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and in the stratum pyramidale and lucidum of CA3 showed strong cytoplasmic labeling for GAP-43. Few cells were labeled in these regions at 2 days, and none at later stages. Pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3 areas and granule cells were never labeled. These studies demonstrate a transient expression of GAP-43 mRNA and protein in a subset of vulnerable neurons after transient brain ischemia. The cytoplasmic localization in hilar neurons could be due to increased synthesis of GAP-43 or to changes in axoplasmic transport. It is suggested that axonal damage occurs in hilar cells which stimulates GAP-43 expression. The increased production of trophic factors after ischemia in granule cells could also cause plastic changes in hilar cells. Since hilar neurons are in a strategic position to control the excitability of the dentate area, increased expression of GAP-43 may indicate an important pathophysiological process. In seizure experiments, strong expression of GAP-43 mRNA in granule cells was associated with abnormal mossy fiber sprouting and development of chronic epilepsy. The relevance of the minor GAP-43 mRNA upregulation after ischemia must be considered. The changes in CA3 neurons at several days after ischemia might represent a plastic response to a loss of CA1 neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The selective delayed neuronal death of CA1 pyramidal cells after transient global ischemia in the gerbil brain can be prevented by preconditioning with a short sublethal period of ischemia 1-7 days prior to a subsequent, usually lethal ischemia of 5 min duration. Since changes of neuronal gene expression may play a crucial role in this tolerance induction, we investigated the postischemic expression profile of the fos, jun and Krox transcription factor families. We have previously reported that a single 5 min period of cerebral ischemia does not cause a de novo synthesis of immediate early gene (IEG) encoded proteins in CA1 neurons. In the present study, two experimental groups of Mongolian gerbils were investigated: one group was subjected to a single tolerance-inducing 2.5 min period of ischemia by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery. The second (combined ischemia) group was subjected to 2.5 min of ischemia, followed by 5 min of ischemia 4 days later. Post-ischemic expression of c-FOS, FOS B, c-JUN, JUN B, JUN D and KROX-24 was investigated by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry up to 48 h of recirculation. In contrast to a single 5 min period of ischemia, 2.5 min caused a postischemic expression of c-JUN protein, but no other IEGs, in CA1 neurons (peak at 6 h). Similarly, a selective but delayed c-JUN expression (peak at 18 h) was observed in animals subjected to combined ischemia. These results indicate that the induction of an endogenous neuroprotective state in CA1 neurons is associated with the activation of a genetic program which involves the expression of specific transcription factors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"This study concerns expression of the genes encoding three multifunctional proteins: clusterin and two complement cascade components, C1q and C4. Previous work from this and other laboratories has established that clusterin, Clq and C4 messenger RNAs are elevated during Alzheimer's disease, and in response to deafferenting and excitotoxic brain lesion. This study addresses hippocampal clusterin, ClqB and C4 expression in response to neurotoxins that caused selective neuron death. Kainate, which preferentially kills hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons but not dentate gyrus granule neurons induced clusterin immunoreactivity in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and adjacent astrocytes, but not in dentate gyrus granule neurons. In contrast, colchicine, which preferentially kills the dentate gyrus granule neurons, induced clusterin immunoreactivity in the local neuropil as punctate deposits, but not in the surviving or degenerating dentate gyrus granule neurons. Clusterin messenger RNA was increased in astrocytes. ClqB and C4 messenger RNAs increased within 48 h after kainate injections, particularly in the CA3 pyramidal layer, less in the dentate gyrus-CA4, and less in CA1. Clq immunoreactivity was detected in CA1 pyramidal neurons and also as small punctate deposits in the CA1 region at eight and 14 days after kainate. The increase of both clusterin and ClqB messenger RNAs after kainate injections was blocked by barbiturates that prevented seizures and neurodegeneration. In primary hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with glutamate, a subpopulation of cultured neurons that survived glutamate toxicity also had parallel elevations of clusterin and ClqB messenger RNA. In conclusion, cytotoxins that target selective hippocampal neurons increase the expression of both clusterin and ClqB in vivo and in vitro. These results show that elevations of clusterin messenger RNA or protein can be dissociated from each other and from cell death. These increased messenger RNAs were associated with immunoreactive deposits that differed by cell type and intra- versus extracellular locations. These results suggest that the complement system is involved in brain responses to injury.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The study details the cellular expression of the dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in the human temporal lobe during prenatal development. At 13 embryonic weeks (E13) D2 mRNA was widely expressed in the temporal lobe. At this time point in the dentate gyrus D2 mRNA positive cells first appeared at the outer border of the granular layer and their number increased with development. The CA1 exhibited the highest level of D2 mRNA expression. By E19-25 the hippocampal formation underwent rapid morphological maturation. D2 mRNA expression became more uniform and dense in the ammonic subfield. At all ages the subiculum appeared more mature morphologically but less intensely stained for D2 mRNA than the ammonic fields. In the entorhinal cortex D2 mRNA expression was most conspicuous in the future layer II at all ages. In the temporal neocortex D2 mRNA-positive cells were detected in the subplate and cortical plate. Differentiation of the cortical plate was accompanied by concentration of D2 mRNA-positive cells in layer V. The most conspicuous cells expressing D2 mRNA were found in the marginal zone of all regions and resembled Cajal-Retzius cells in morphology and location. Density of putative Cajal-Retzius cells expressing D2 mRNA decreased with development. They all but disappeared from the hippocampal areas by mid gestation, but in the temporal neocortex occasional cells were seen even at term. Early and widespread but region and cell type specific expression of D2 receptor mRNA suggests an important role of this DA receptor subtype in prenatal development of the human temporal lobe.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We report that kainic acid-induced seizures lead to marked increases in mRNAs encoding basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF and aFGF, respectively) and flg, one of their receptors, in the rat hippocampus. Anticonvulsant pretreatment inhibits the up-regulation of these mRNAs. The observed increase in flg mRNA levels involves the pyramidal cells of all hippocampal subfields and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus. The increased expression of aFGF and bFGF mRNAs is limited to neuron populations that are resistant to seizure-induced injury, the granular cells of dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of CA1 region, respectively.

       "  'Abstract': 'Because exogenous application of a number of cytokines and growth factors can alter synaptic properties, we sought to determine if endogenous cytokine expression is affected by neuronal activity. In addition, we examined whether cytokine expression is altered by the techniques used to stimulate and record from hippocampal neurons. Using semi-quantitative RNase protection and RT-PCR assays, we studied the expression of 18 cytokine, growth factor, and receptor genes in the hippocampus following the induction of Schaffer collateral-CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP). We found that various cytokines are dramatically induced following preparation of slices for in vitro recording and as a result of injury following acute electrode placement in vivo. These increases can be overcome in vivo, however, using permanent electrodes implanted three weeks prior to testing. Using this chronic preparation, we found that interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA was upregulated nearly 20-fold by LTP induction in vivo, marking the first demonstration of endogenous regulation of this cytokine in response to LTP. In situ hybridization for IL-6 revealed that upregulation is tightly localized near the site of stimulation and is detected only in non-neuronal cells, identified as GFAP+ astrocytes and GFAP- cells within proximal blood vessels. Coupled with previous results showing that exogenously applied IL-6 can prevent the induction of LTP, this finding suggests a mechanism by which the local release of a cytokine could regulate LTP at nearby sites.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Both glucocorticoids and serotonin have been implicated in the regulation of mood and neuroendocrine control. In this study we have examined the effects of the psychomotor stimulant, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on corticosteroid and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype gene expression within the hippocampal formation using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Animals were injected subcutaneously with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (20 mg/kg) twice daily for four days. Two weeks following this dosage regimen, shown to markedly reduce 5-hydroxytryptamine terminals, both glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression were significantly decreased (30-47% fall) in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of CA1-CA4 fields of Ammon's horn, but not in parietal cortex neurons. In the same rats, 5-hydroxytryptamine1C receptor messenger RNA expression was significantly increased in CA3 pyramidal neurons (133% rise), but neither 5-hydroxytryptamine1A or 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptor messenger RNA levels were altered in any dorsal hippocampal subfield. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine treatment was associated with modest hypersecretion of coricosterone during the diurnal nadir, without other peripheral evidence of chronic glucocorticoid excess (unchanged thymic and adrenal weights and corticosterone-binding globulin levels). These results emphasize the importance of the serotonergic innervation in maintaining hippocampal corticosteroid receptor gene expression. It is suggested that 5-hydroxytryptamine1C receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of serotonin on hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor expression and perhaps mood.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Early induction of the mRNAs encoding the c-Fos and c-Jun nuclear proteins was examined in rat brain by in situ hybridization at various timepoints following global forebrain ischemia by the method of four-vessel occlusion. All animals were subjected to 20 min of transient ischemia. This produced a pattern of proto-oncogene activation that was most intense in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus 30 min after ischemia, while the hilar cells in the dentate and the pyramidal cells of the CA3 region in the hippocampus showed a more delayed but robust expression of these immediate early genes at 1 h. The neurons of the CA1 region exhibited a more moderate hybridization signal at 1-2 h postischemia. Very little hybridization signal for either immediate early gene could be detected in animals perfused with fixative immediately following ischemia, suggesting that cellular energy levels may have to be restored to a certain level before efficient de novo mRNA synthesis can occur. In the cerebellum, a similar temporal pattern was observed: the granule cells exhibited a prompt but patchy expression of c-fos and c-jun that was followed by a delayed signal in the Purkinje cells. Without exception c-fos and c-jun appeared to be expressed in unison, although the time course of c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation and decay was different in various brain regions: invariably the cerebellum returned rapidly to its baseline with virtually no remaining signal at 3 h postischemia, while c-fos and c-jun activation in the hippocampus remained high at 3 h and returned to baseline by 6 h. Several other brain regions showed early production of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs, such as the medial habenula, piriform cortex, the amygdala, the centromedian, lateral posterior, paracentral, intermediodorsal and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus and the ventromedial and dorsal nuclei of the hypothalamus; in the brainstem, the trapezoid body and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus as well as the adrenergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (C1 group) and nucleus tractus solitarius (C2 group) regions displayed slightly less intense hybridization signals. In addition, the ependyma of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle showed a prompt albeit short-lived production of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs. Sham-operated animals as well as animals that had survived to one week postischemia showed either no or only trace levels of hybridization signal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

Here we examined, using in situ hybridization histochemistry, the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), an inducible and abundant neuropeptide in mammalian brain with known neuroregulatory functions, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astroglial activation, in the hippocampus at different time points following intracerebral prion inoculation in male CD-1 mice. Between 110 and 140 days postinoculation NPY mRNA expression was specifically up-regulated in CA3 pyramidal neurones, whereas expression of NPY in hilar neurones remained unaltered. Up-regulation of GFAP mRNA was observed in the CA1 stratum radiatum at 60 days, and spread throughout the hippocampus, cortex and thalamus between 110 and 140 days, suggesting early accumulation of scrapie prion protein in these regions. The clinical symptoms were first manifested 120 days postinoculation. Aberrant induction of NPY mRNA in the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurones preceded the onset of neurological symptoms, and may be involved in the regulation of glutamate release at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in scrapie-infected mice.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), an EGF receptor ligand, was investigated in rat forebrain under basal conditions and after kainate-induced excitotoxic seizures. In addition, a potential neuroprotective role for HB-EGF was assessed in hippocampal cultures. In situ hybridization analysis of HB-EGF mRNA in developing rat hippocampus revealed its expression in all principle cell layers of hippocampus from birth to postnatal day (P) 7, whereas from P14 through adulthood, expression decreased in the pyramidal cell layer versus the dentate gyrus granule cells. After kainate-induced excitotoxic seizures, levels of HB-EGF mRNA increased markedly in the hippocampus, as well as in several other cortical and limbic forebrain regions. In the hippocampus, HB-EGF mRNA expression increased within 3 hr after kainate treatment, continued to increase until 24 hr, and then decreased; increases occurred in the dentate gyrus granule cells, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and in and around hippocampal pyramidal CA3 and CA1 neurons. At 48 hr after kainate treatment, HB-EGF mRNA remained elevated in vulnerable brain regions of the hippocampus and amygdaloid complex. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of HB-EGF protein in the hippocampus after kainate administration, with a peak at 24 hr. Pretreatment of embryonic hippocampal cell cultures with HB-EGF protected neurons against kainate toxicity. The kainate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in hippocampal neurons was not altered in cultures pretreated with HB-EGF, suggesting an excitoprotective mechanism different from that of previously characterized excitoprotective growth factors. Taken together, these results suggest that HB-EGF may function as an endogenous neuroprotective agent after seizure-induced neural activity/injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effects of kainic acid (15 mg/kg i.p.) on alpha subunits of the Gs and Go protein mRNA levels in the rat hippocampal formation were investigated. An in situ hybridization study showed an increase in the Gs alpha mRNA level in the dentate gyrus at 3 h (by ca. 17%), 24 h (by ca. 75%), 72 h (by ca. 89%) and 30 days (by ca. 59%) after kainic acid administration. An emulsion autoradiography revealed enhancement in the Gs alpha mRNA signal intensity over granular cells of the dentate gyrus and over some hilar cells adjacent to the granule cell layer, most likely in GABA interneurons. The Gs alpha mRNA showed a slight tendency to increase in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers at 3 h after kainic acid administration, but it decreased after 24 h, 72 h and 30 days. The latter decrease correlated well with the pyramidal cells loss in those areas. Kainic acid differently influenced the Go alpha mRNA level in the dentate gyrus: it had no effect after 3 h, while after 24 h the mRNA level tended to decrease (by ca. 16%); then it increased after 72 h (by ca. 20%) and, to a lesser extent, after 30 days (by ca. 12%). The Go alpha mRNA level in CA1 and CA3 tended to decrease at 3 h after kainic acid administration; the signal completely disappeared after 24, 72 h as well as after 30 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR) activation in the hippocampus and neocortex plays a central role in memory and cognitive function. We analyzed the cellular expression of the five NR subunit (NR1 and NR2A-D) mRNAs in these regions with in situ hybridization and human ribonucleotide probes. Film autoradiograms demonstrated a distinct pattern of hybridization signal in the hippocampal complex and the neocortex with probes for NR1, NR2A, and NR2B mRNA. NR2C and NR2D probes yielded scattered signals without a distinct organization. At the emulsion level, the NR1 probe produced high-density hybridization signals across the hippocampal complex. NR2A mRNA was higher in dentate granule cells and pyramidal cells in CA1 and subiculum compared to hilus neurons. NR2B mRNA expression was moderate throughout, with higher expression in dentate granule cells, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells than in hilus neurons. In the hippocampal complex, the NR2C probe signal was not different from background in any region, whereas the NR2D probe signal resulted in low to moderate grain densities. We analyzed NR subunit mRNA expression in the prefrontal, parietal, primary visual, and motor cortices. All areas displayed strong NR1 hybridization signals. NR2A and NR2B mRNAs were expressed in cortical areas and layers. NR2C mRNA was expressed at low levels in distinct layers that differed by region and the NR2D signal was equally moderate throughout all regions. Pyramidal cells in both hippocampus and neocortex express NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and, to a lesser extent, NR2D mRNA. Interneurons or granular layer neurons and some glial cells express NR2C mRNA.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ribonuclease protection analysis and quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry were used to investigate the coordination and regional expression of catalytic and non-catalytic trkB messenger RNAs in the adult rat hippocampus following systemic kainate-induced seizures. Changes in trkB expression were compared with the messenger RNA expression of its neurotrophic ligands, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3. TrkB messenger RNA expression was increased in the dentate granule cells at 1-4 h following the onset of seizures, and returned to control levels 16-24 h thereafter. In addition, seizures also induced expression of trkB messenger RNA in putative non-neuronal cells at four to seven days in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 region. Hybridization with probes specific for the non-catalytic trkB receptor and the catalytic trkB receptor revealed that the increases at four and seven days in the molecular layers of the hippocampus reflected an up-regulation of only the non-catalytic form of the receptor. Furthermore, the neuronal increases observed 1-4 h were due to an up-regulation of both trkB TK- and trkB TK+ messenger RNAs. It was established that systemic administration of kainate increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels in the pyramidal and granule cell regions of the hippocampus 1-4 h following the onset of behaviorally manifested seizure activity. Early changes in neuronal expression of trkB TK- and trkB TK+ messenger RNA paralleled changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA in the dentate granule cell and CA1 pyramidal cell layers, but not in the CA3 subregion. These data suggest that concomitant regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its cognate receptor may play a role in the selective vulnerability of hippocampal subregions to kainate-induced neuropathology. Furthermore, these data suggest a dual function for trkB receptor expression in the hippocampus following kainate-induced seizures, possibly related to both the plastic and degenerative consequences of seizure induction by kainate.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The reorganizations of the overall intrinsic glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic hippocampal networks as well as the time course of these reorganizations during development of pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy were studied with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). These transporters are particularly interesting as specific markers for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively, whose expression levels could reflect the demand for synaptic transmission and their average activity. We report that 1) concomitantly with the loss of some subpopulations of VGAT-containing neurons, there was an up-regulation of VGAT synthesis in all remaining GABA neurons as early as 1 week after pilocarpine injection. This enhanced synthesis is characterized by marked increases in the relative amount of VGAT mRNAs in interneurons associated with increased intensity of axon terminal labeling for VGAT in all hippocampal layers. 2) There was a striking loss of mossy cells during the latent period, demonstrated by a long-term decrease of VGLUT1 mRNA-containing hilar neurons and associated loss of VGLUT1-containing terminals in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer. 3) There were aberrant VGLUT1-containing terminals at the chronic stage resulting from axonal sprouting of granule and pyramidal cells. This is illustrated by a recovery of VGLUT1 immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer and an increased VGLUT1 immunolabeling in the CA1-CA3 dendritic layers. These data indicate that an increased activity of remaining GABAergic interneurons occurs during the latent period, in parallel with the loss of vulnerable glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons preceding the reorganization of glutamatergic networks.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Increased cyclin D1 in vulnerable neurons in the hippocampus after ischaemia and epilepsy: a modulator of in vivo programmed cell death?',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Several observations suggest that delayed neuronal death in ischaemia, epilepsy and other brain disorders includes an apoptotic component, involving programmed cell death (PCD). PCD is hypothesized to result, in part, from aberrant control of the cell cycle. Because they are instrumental in mitosis, cyclins D are key markers to evaluate whether neurons indeed progress into the cell cycle in situations of pathology. Therefore, we investigated in rat brains, the expression of cyclins D in the delayed neuronal death that occurs following transient global ischaemia and kainate-induced seizures. Following a four-vessel occlusion insult, quantitative in situ hybridization revealed a highly significant and persistent 100% increase of cyclin D1 mRNA in the vulnerable pyramidal neurons of the CA1 hippocampal region. Ischaemia also induced a smaller and transient cyclin D1 mRNA increase in the resistant CA3 area and dentate gyrus. In contrast, the cyclin D2 and D3 mRNAs, expressed constitutively in the adult rat hippocampus, were not upregulated. Following kainate-induced seizures, cyclin D1 mRNA was induced in the vulnerable CA3 region, and to a lesser extent, in non-vulnerable regions. Cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry revealed increased protein levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons commited to die after ischaemia. Double labelling experiments indicate that cyclin D1 is also expressed in reactive astrocytes but not in microglial cells. Finally, we report that in neurons, cyclin D1 expression peaks before nuclear condensation and the appearance of DNA fragmentation. We propose that cyclin D1, when expressed at high levels in lesioned neurons, may act as a modulator of apoptosis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are Ca(2+)-permeable, nonspecific cation channels that can be activated through direct interaction with cAMP and/or cGMP. Recent electrophysiological evidence for these channels in cultured hippocampal neurons prompted us to investigate the expression of CNG channel genes in hippocampus. PCR amplification detected the expression of transcripts for subunit 1 of both the rod photoreceptor (RCNGC1) and the olfactory receptor cell (OCNGC1) subtype of CNG channel in adult rat hippocampus. In situ hybridization detected expression of both channel subtypes in most principal neurons, including pyramidal cells of the CA1 through CA3 regions and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. From the hybridization patterns, we conclude that the two genes are colocalized in individual neurons. Comparison of the patterns of expression of type 1 cGMP-dependent protein kinase and the CNG channels suggests that hippocampal neurons can respond to changes in cGMP levels with both rapid changes in CNG channel activity and slower changes induced by phosphorylation. Future models of hippocampal function should include CNG channels and their effects on both electrical responses and intracellular Ca2+ levels.',\n",

The metabolism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is rather complex: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase produces inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, a putative second messenger. In order to elucidate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate function, a comparative in situ hybridization study of the distributions of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase and receptor mRNAs was performed in the adult rat brain using oligonucleotides derived from their cDNA sequences. The neuronal distributions of the mRNA for the receptor were larger than for the kinase. Highest levels of both mRNAs were found in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, where they were enriched in their neuronal perikarya and to a lesser extent in their dendrites. In addition to the cerebellum, mRNAs were mainly detected in the hippocampal pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector of the Ammon's horn and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and also in a majority of the neurons in the cortical layers II-III and V, especially in the frontal cortex and cingulate cortex; caudate-putamen, accumbens, olfactory tubercle and Calleja islets; claustrum; anterior olfactory nucleus; taenia tecta; piriform cortex; dorsolateral septum; bed nucleus stria terminalis; amygdala; hippocampal CA2-4 sectors and subiculum. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor mRNA but not kinase mRNA was found in a majority of the neurons in the thalamus, especially in the parafascicular nucleus; hypothalamus, especially the medial hypothalamus; substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area; superior colliculus; lateral interpeduncular nucleus and central gray. Taking into account the limitation in sensitivity of the technique, both mRNAs were not detected in glial cells and in the olfactory bulb; basal nucleus of Meynert, diagonal band nuclei; medial septal nucleus; substantia innominata; globus pallidus; entopeduncular nucleus; substantia nigra pars reticulata; ventral pallidum; subthalamic nucleus; spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. In conclusion, cerebellum and hippocampus appear to contain almost similar levels of kinase mRNA. This is in contrast to receptor mRNA levels which were at much higher levels in the cerebellum when compared with the hippocampus. For this reason, we have chosen hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells for studying inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase function.\",\n",

In situ hybridization analyses showed that virus-derived antisense transcripts were detected up to 5 weeks postinfection (p.i.). Although immunological methods failed to demonstrate a reduction of NMDA receptor protein, whole-cell recording showed that neurons in the transduced regions were deficient in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic currents.

       "  'Abstract': 'It is widely believed that expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter genes VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 is restricted to glutamatergic neurons and that the two transporters segregate in different sets of neurons. Using single-cell multiplex RT-PCR (sc-RT-mPCR), we show that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNAs were coexpressed in most of the sampled neurons from the rat hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum at postnatal Day (P)14 but not P60. In accordance, changes in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 mRNA concentrations were found to occur in these and other brain areas between P14 and P60, as revealed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and quantitated by ribonuclease protection assay. VGLUT1 and -2 coexpression in the hippocampal formation is supported further by in situ hybridization data showing that virtually all cells in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal and granule cell layers were highly positive for both transcripts until P14. It was revealed using sc-RT-mPCR that transcripts for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were also present in neurons of the cerebellum, striatum, and septum that expressed markers for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic or cholinergic phenotypes, as well as in hippocampal cells containing transcripts for the glial fibrillary acidic protein. Our study suggests that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 proteins may often transport glutamate into vesicles within the same neuron, especially during early postnatal development, and that they are expressed widely in presumed glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons, as well as in astrocytes. Furthermore, our study shows that such coexpressing neurons remain in the adult brain and identifies several areas that contain them in both young and adult rats.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Brain ageing is associated with a dysregulation of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis which leads to deficits in Ca(2+)-dependent signalling pathways and altered neuronal functions. Given the crucial role of neurogranin/RC3 (Ng) in the post-synaptic regulation of Ca(2+) and calmodulin levels, age-dependent changes in the levels of Ng mRNA and protein expression were analysed in 3, 12, 24 and 31-month-old mouse brains. Ageing produced significant decreases in Ng mRNA expression in the dorsal hippocampal subfields, retrosplenial and primary motor cortices, whereas no reliable changes were seen in any other cortical regions examined. Western blot indicated that Ng protein expression was also down-regulated in the ageing mouse brain. Analysis of Ng immunoreactivity in both hippocampal CA1 and retrosplenial areas indicated that Ng protein in aged mice decreased predominantly in the dendritic segments of pyramidal neurones. These data suggest that age-related changes of post-synaptic Ng in selected brain areas, and particularly in hippocampus, may contribute to altered Ca(2+)/calmodulin-signalling pathways and to region-specific impairments of synaptic plasticity and cognitive decline.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Electroconvulsive seizures increase the expression of MAP kinase phosphatases in limbic regions of rat brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades regulate a variety of cellular activities, including cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis, and are reported to play a role in the actions of antidepressant treatment. There are a number of different classes of protein phosphatases that could influence the MAP kinase cascade. One of these, the MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP) family, is known to play a key role in dephosphorylation of activated MAP kinase. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of the MKP1, MKP2, and MKP3 isoforms in rat brain after electroconvulsive seizure (ECS), considered the most effective treatment for depression. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrates that ECS differentially regulates the expression of the MKP isoforms. Expression of MKP1 mRNA is robustly increased by acute ECS in the major cell layers of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers. In contrast, MKP2 is induced mainly in the dentate gyrus and MKP3 is preferentially increased in the CA1 and CA3 cell layers. In the prefrontal cortex, all three MKP isoforms are upregulated by acute ECS administration. Chronic ECS resulted in a similar pattern of induction for each of the MKP subtypes, demonstrating that there is little or no desensitization of the response to repeated ECS. The induction of MKP expression serves as negative feedback control for the MAP kinase cascades. Upregulation of MKP expression could dampen the actions of ECS, indicating that blockade of the MKPs could enhance the actions of antidepressant treatment.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Prolonged expression of zinc finger immediate-early gene mRNAs and decreased protein synthesis following kainic acid induced seizures.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In the present study in situ hybridization was used to study the effect of kainic acid induced seizures on the expression of the zinc finger immediate-early genes (IEGs) NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C, egr-2; egr-3 and Nurr1. Kainic acid markedly induced these IEGs especially in hippocampus, cortex and amygdala by 30 min. This induction gradually decreased and returned to baseline by 24 h in most regions. However, in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus known to be damaged by kainic acid the expression of all the IEGs except egr-2 remained elevated for 24 h. NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and to a lesser extent, Nurr1, remained elevated also in the subcortical region of the temporal lobe. By 24 h incorporation of 14C-leucine decreased in the piriform cortex, amygdala, and in the CA1 and CA3 subfields, but not in CA2 and dentate gyrus. These areas showing decreased protein synthesis in the hippocampus by 24 h showed prolonged IEG induction, whereas IEG expression returned to control levels in areas showing normal protein synthesis. In the temporal lobe decreased protein synthesis coexisted with decreased IEG expression, whereas areas in the vicinity of the region showing decreased protein synthesis demonstrated elevated IEG expression. The decreased protein synthesis was localized in areas where extensive neuronal death has occurred. This prolonged IEG induction in the hippocampus, which has been linked with neuronal death, could solely represent a prolonged mRNA turnover caused by disrupted protein synthesis. The prolonged IEG expression in the temporal lobe appeared to be localized in regions where the cells are in stress, but still viable. The sustained IEG expression might therefore either represent a stress response by which the neurons are trying to protect themselves or, alternatively, the IEG response may be an early sign indicating that these cells are initiating a pathway leading to programmed cell death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were applied to investigate changes in the expression of somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, neurokinin B, cholecystokinin, dynorphin, and Met-enkephalin in the rat hippocampus after administration of a single peroral dose of trimethyltin hydroxide (9 mg/kg). Two time intervals were investigated: 5 days after trimethyltin treatment, when CA3 damage becomes manifest and is associated with increased aggression, seizure susceptibility, and memory deficit, and 16 days after trimethyltin, when neuronal damage is almost maximal and seizure susceptibility is declining. Robust but transient increases of neuropeptide Y, neurokinin B, and Met-enkephalin mRNA levels were revealed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and increased neuropeptide Y and neurokinin B immunoreactivities were found in mossy fibers. In reverse, dynorphin mRNA and immunoreactivity were decreased transiently in the dentate gyrus and mossy fibers, respectively. Strong over-expression of NPY mRNA was also observed in hilar interneurons and in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells as well as in the cortex at 5 days postdosing. Cholecystokinin- or neurokinin B-containing basket cells were preserved, while somatostatin-bearing interneurons were damaged by trimethyltin exposure. These neurochemical changes induced by trimethyltin intoxication strikingly parallel to those observed in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy and may reflect activation of endogenous protective mechanisms. It is also suggested that hilar interneurons respond differently to trimethyltin exposure, for which neuropeptides are valuable markers.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide stimulates cholinergic phenotype development by inducing choline acetyltransferase in the rat medial septal nucleus in vitro. Adult senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8, a substrain of the senescence-accelerated-prone mouse, show a remarkable age-accelerated deterioration in learning and memory. We cloned mouse hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein complementary DNA. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that the neurostimulating peptide itself is the same as that found in the rat. In situ hybridization revealed that the highest expression of the precursor protein messenger RNA was in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Compared with a strain of senescence-accelerated-resistant mouse (control mouse), adult senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8 showed increased expression of both the precursor messenger RNA and the neurostimulating peptide-related immunodeposits in the hippocampal CA1 field. The deposits were intensely and diffusely precipitated in neuropils throughout the strata oriens and radiatum in senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8, but not in control mice. The neurostimulating peptide content in the hippocampus was higher in senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8 than in control mice, while its precursor protein itself was not different between the two strains. Furthermore, our previous and present data show that the medial septal and hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity was significantly lower in senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8 than in control mice. The data suggest that, in hippocampal neurons in adult senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8, the production of hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide precursor protein in neuronal somata, which is associated with an increased expression of its messenger RNA in the CA1 field, occurs as a consequence of low activity in their presynaptic cholinergic neurons. This is followed by accelerated processing to generate bioactive peptide and transport to its functional fields. However, certain mechanisms reduce the release of the peptide and lead to its accumulation in the neuropil. These disturbances of the septohippocampal cholinergic system might be the biochemical mechanism underlying the characteristic deterioration of senescence-accelerated-prone mice/8.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution of AMPA-selective subunits, GluR1-4, was determined in the human hippocampus and cerebellum by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. In the hippocampus, in situ hybridization revealed that GluR1 and GluR2 mRNAs were similarly distributed and highly expressed in the dentate gyrus, with lower levels in the CA regions. GluR3 and GluR4 mRNAs were expressed at very low levels. Immunocytochemical studies showed that GluR1- and GluR2/3-immunoreactivity were highest in the dentate molecular and granular layers. In the CA regions, GluR1 and GluR2/3 staining was observed in pyramidal cell bodies and surrounding neuropil and was more intense in CA4/3/2 compared with CA1. GluR4-immunoreactivity was low throughout the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, GluR1 and GluR4 transcripts were expressed in the granular and Purkinje cell/Bergmann glia layers. GluR2 mRNA was highly expressed in the granular layer and individual Purkinje cells, while GluR3 mRNA was not detectable in the cerebellum. GluR1- and GluR4-immunoreactivity were localized to Purkinje cells and putative Bergmann glia, as well as their processes extending into the molecular layer. GluR2/3 staining was intense in Purkinje cells, with moderate staining in the granular layer. Thus, GluR1-4 subunits are differentially distributed in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, the distribution of subunit mRNA and protein correlate well with each other and with the glutamatergic neuroanatomy of the hippocampus and cerebellum.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Recent evidence has demonstrated regional synthesis of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in rat brain, which is also known to contain widespread specific type I IGF receptors. In order to precisely define sites of IGF-I mRNA synthesis, and their relationship to IGF-I receptor sites, we have applied the techniques of in situ hybridization and in vitro receptor autoradiography in rat brain. Frozen sections of adult rat brain and liver were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA inserts for human IGF-I (780 base pairs) or a positive control transthyretin cDNA (1430 base pairs) probe, or a series of negative probes, followed by film or emulsion autoradiography. Receptor autoradiography was performed on similar sections using 125I-IGF-I in buffer, some chambers containing excess unlabeled IGF-I. Hybridization of IGF-I probe was clearly seen only in three major brain regions: the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum, whereas transthyretin only hybridized to choroid plexus as expected, and other probes showed no hybridization. In olfactory bulb, hybridization was greatest in the internal granular and mitral cell layers, with lower levels in the glomerular layer, where IGF-I receptors were concentrated. In hippocampus, hybridization was to pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn in CA1 and CA2 layers and dentate gyrus, with some labeling in CA3. IGF-I receptors were most dense in CA2, CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus. In cerebellum, hybridization was to the granule cell layer, with IGF-I receptors primarily in the adjacent molecular layer. We have clearly demonstrated precise sites of local IGF-I synthesis in adult rat brain, adjacent to, and sometimes overlapping sites of high density IGF-I receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"We have used nonisotopic in situ hybridization techniques with biotinylated junctional oligonucleotide probes to study expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) 695 and 751 mRNA in the hippocampal formation of Alzheimer's disease. Both mRNAs are strongly expressed in neurons of the hippocampal formation, particularly in the dentate gyrus granule cells and the pyramidal neurons of CA3. The patterns of expression of neither APP695 nor APP751 mRNA correlate well with the stereotyped topography of neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques, which occur primarily in CA1 and subiculum. We double-labeled in situ sections with immunohistochemical reagents for neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques. Neurons that contain neurofibrillary tangles continue to express APP mRNA. The level of APP695 and APP751 was measured semiquantitatively by optical density measurements in neurons that were close to (within 25 microns) or father from a senile plaque (more than 100 microns). There was no increase in expression in neurons in the immediate microenvironment of senile plaques. Our results suggest that no major change in distribution or type of APP mRNA accompanies neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque development.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Prolonged benzodiazepine treatment of rats results in anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo. Studies of in vitro hippocampal slices following 1 wk flurazepam administration show reduced GABA-mediated inhibition in the CA1 region, and a decrease in GABAA agonist and benzodiazepine potency to inhibit CA1 pyramidal cell-evoked responses. To investigate the molecular basis of benzodiazepine tolerance in the hippocampus, in situ hybridization techniques were used to evaluate the expression of the mRNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 5, and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor in the hippocampal formation and frontal cortex of chronic flurazepam-treated rats. A discretely localized decrease in alpha 1, but not alpha 5 or gamma 2 mRNA expression was found in the CA1 region (35-40%) and in layers II-III and IV of cortex (50-60%) 2 d after cessation of flurazepam treatment. The decrease in the expression of alpha 1 subunit mRNA in cortex is similar to that reported following other chronic benzodiazepine treatment regimens. This is the first report of a reduction in alpha 1 subunit mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'BTB/POZ (broad complex tramtrack bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger) zinc finger factors are a class of nuclear DNA-binding proteins involved in development, chromatin remodeling, and cancer. However, BTB/POZ domain zinc finger factors linked to development of the mammalian cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and macroglia have not been described previously. We report here the isolation and characterization of two novel nuclear BTB/POZ domain zinc finger isoforms, designated HOF(L) and HOF(S), that are specifically expressed in early hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and gliogenic progenitors as well as in differentiated glia. During embryonic development of the murine cerebral cortex, HOF expression is restricted to the hippocampal subdivision. Expression coincides with early differentiation of presumptive CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells, with a sharp decline in expression at the CA1/subicular border. By using bromodeoxyuridine labeling and immunohistochemistry, we show that HOF expression coincides with immature non-dividing cells and is down-regulated in differentiated cells, suggesting a role for HOF in hippocampal neurogenesis. Consistent with the postulated role of the POZ domain as a site for protein-protein interactions, both HOF isoforms are able to dimerize. The HOF zinc fingers bind specifically to the binding site for the related promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein as well as to a newly identified DNA sequence.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution of the auxiliary GABAB receptor subunits KCTD8, 12, 12b, and 16 in the mouse brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). KCTD8, 12, 12b, and 16 were recently identified as auxiliary GABA(B) receptor subunits and distinctly influence biophysical and pharmacological properties of the receptor response. Here we examined the expression patterns of the KCTDs in the mouse brain. Using in situ hybridization analysis, we found that most neurons express KCTD transcripts, supporting biochemical data showing that most GABA(B) receptors in the brain incorporate KCTD proteins. In the adult brain, KCTD12 and 16 have a widespread and KCTD8 and 12b a restricted expression pattern. Individual neurons can coexpress multiple KCTDs, as shown for granule cells and CA1/CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus that coexpress KCTD12 and 16. In contrast, granule, Purkinje, and Golgi cells in the cerebellum selectively express one KCTD at a time. The expression levels of individual KCTD transcripts vary during postnatal brain development. Immunohistochemistry reveals that individual KCTD proteins can exhibit distinct axonal or dendritic localizations in neuronal populations. KCTDs are also detectable in nonneuronal tissues not expected to express GABA(B) receptors, suggesting that the role of KCTD proteins extends beyond GABA(B) receptors. In summary, our findings support that most brain GABA(B) receptors associate with KCTD proteins, but that the repertoire and abundance of KCTDs varies during development, among brain areas, neuronal populations, and at subcellular sites. We propose that the distinct spatial and temporal KCTD distribution patterns underlie functional differences in native GABA(B) responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The regional distribution of the mRNA encoding the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor was studied in the central nervous system of the rat by in situ hybridization histochemistry and Northern blot analysis. A 180 base pair probe, corresponding to a highly selective portion of the third intracellular loop of the rat 5-HT1B receptor, was used. In most regions, a single 5 kb message was found by Northern blot analysis. However, two additional bands (2.5 and 4 kb) were detected in the striatum. The rank order of 5-HT1B mRNA abundance was striatum >> septum = ventral tegmentum > or = colliculi = hypothalamus = hippocampus > brain stem > or = cerebellum > or = dorsal horn of the spinal cord > cerebral cortex > or = ventral horn of the spinal cord > olfactory tubercle. This distribution was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which further revealed that the 5-HT1B mRNA was present in dorsal root ganglia, the layer IV of the cerebral cortex, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. In situ hybridization was also performed in nomifensine (10 mg/kg/i.p.)-pretreated rats whose serotoninergic neurons were extensively and selectively lesioned by microinjection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (8 micrograms/1 microliter) directly into the anteroventral vicinity of anterior raphe nuclei 3 weeks before sacrifice. In lesioned rats, 5-HT1B mRNA was present in the same areas and at the same levels as in control rats, except in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, where a marked decrease (-75%) in its local concentration was observed. These data provide the first demonstration of the synthesis of 5-HT1B receptor within serotoninergic neurons, as expected of their presynaptic autoreceptor function at the level of serotoninergic terminals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Immunohistological and in situ hybridization techniques were used to study the influence of kainic acid-induced seizures and of pentylenetetrazol kindling on neurokinin B immunoreactivity and neurokinin B mRNA in the rat hippocampus. Pronounced increases in neurokinin B immunoreactivity were observed in the terminal field of mossy fibres 10-60 days after intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid. These slow but persistent increases in immunoreactivity were accompanied by markedly enhanced expression of neurokinin B mRNA in the granule cells and in hilar interneurons adjacent to the granule cell layer. These changes were preceded by transient increases in neurokinin B mRNA and immunoreactivity in CA1 pyramidal cell layer two and 10 days after kainic acid, which, however, subsided later on. Pentylenetetrazol kindling caused similar increases in neurokinin B mRNA expression in granule cells and in CA1 pyramidal cells, but not in hilar interneurons. In CA1, increased neurokinin B message was present two days after termination of the kindling procedure but not after 10 days. Sixty days after kainic acid injection, neurokinin B immunoreactivity extended to the inner-third of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. After pentylenetetrazol kindling, a neurokinin B-immunoreactive band was observed in the infrapyramidal region of CA3. Lesions of the dentate granule cells by local injection of colchicine in kainic acid-treated rats abolished the supragranular neurokinin B-positive staining, whereas it was almost unchanged after transection of the ventral hippocampal commissure. These observations suggest that neurokinin B immunoreactivity may be located in ipsilateral mossy fibres undergoing collateral sprouting to the inner molecular layer or to the infrapyramidal region in CA3, respectively. Preprotachykinin A mRNA, which encodes for neurokinin A and substance P, and substance P immunoreactivity were not changed in the hippocampus of epileptic rats compared with untreated animals. The observed changes in neurokinin B immunoreactivity and mRNA indicate that specific functional and morphological changes may be induced in hippocampal neurons by recurrent limbic seizures.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Visualizing changes in circuit activity resulting from denervation and reinnervation using immediate early gene expression.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'We describe a novel strategy to evaluate circuit function after brain injury that takes advantage of experience-dependent immediate early gene (IEG) expression. When normal rats undergo training or are exposed to a novel environment, there is a strong induction of IEG expression in forebrain regions, including the hippocampus. This gene induction identifies the neurons that are engaged during the experience. Here, we demonstrate that experience-dependent IEG induction is diminished after brain injury in young adult rats (120-200 gm), specifically after unilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex (EC), and then recovers with a time course consistent with reinnervation. In situ hybridization techniques were used to assess the expression of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein Arc at various times after the lesion (4, 8, 12, 16, or 30 d). One group of rats was allowed to explore a complex novel environment for 1 hr; control operated animals remained in their home cage. In unoperated animals, exposure to the novel environment induced Arc mRNA levels in most pyramidal neurons in CA1, in many pyramidal neurons in CA3, and in a small number of dentate granule cells. This characteristic pattern of induction was absent at early time points after unilateral EC lesions (4 and 8 d) but recovered progressively at later time points. The recovery of Arc expression occurred with approximately the same time course as the reinnervation of the dentate gyrus as a result of postlesion sprouting. These results document a novel approach for quantitatively assessing activity-regulated gene expression in polysynaptic circuits after trauma.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution of somatostatin receptor subtype 1 mRNA in the developing cerebral hemispheres of the rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Somatostatin (SST) is one of the major peptide transmitters in the mammalian central nervous system and also seems to exert specific functions during brain development. In contrast to ligand binding experiments, by which two pharmacologically different binding sites were characterized, molecular cloning techniques have led to the identification of at least five different receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5), which according to RNA blot analyses seem to be differentially distributed and regulated in the developing brain. In order to provide more precise data on the distribution of SSTR1 during ontogenesis, we have performed an in situ hybridization analysis, using a 35S-labelled RNA probe, in the developing rat cortex between embryonic day (E)12 and adulthood. Within the cortical plate, expression of SSTR1 gene was first detected in parallel with the establishment of the deep laminae V/VI at E16, thereby following the characteristic morphogenetic gradients of cortical plate construction. Thus, with the subsequent addition of cells along the radial dimension, e.g. the deposition of the supragranular neurons beyond E18, the hybridization signal spreads as an uniform homogenous band through the entire cortical plate, whereby silver grains reach their peak density around birth. Similar developmental gradients were observed along the lateromedial and frontooccipital dimension, whereby SSTR1 transcripts were detected near the frontal pole and the lateral cortical areas roughly 2 days before they appeared in the occipital and medial cortical anlage, respectively. From the initially homogenous distribution, two distinct SSTR1 mRNA-positive bands coextensive with laminae V/VI and II/III, respectively, and sparing lamina IV evolved during the first postnatal week, the grain density of which decreased during further postnatal development. Within the hippocampal formation, SSTR1 transcripts were initially observed at E18 in the subicular complex, and after birth also extending into the neighboring CA1 region. During the 1st and 2nd postnatal week, silver grains were observed over the pyramidal cell layer of CA2 and CA3 and as a faint supragranular band in the dentate gyrus. Similar to the isocortex, grain density decreased thereafter. Hypothetically, the pronounced temporospatial regulation of SSTR1 gene expression during brain development can be correlated with (1) the establishment and eventual reduction of transient cortical SSTergic neuron populations described for late pregnancy and early postnatal development and (2) a receptor subtype exchange during maturation as evidenced by the late (from postnatal day 7 onward) appearance of e.g. SSTR3.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression profile of addicsin/GTRAP3-18 mRNA in mouse brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Addicsin is a murine homologue of rat glutamate-transporter-associated protein 3-18 (GTRAP3-18), a putative modulator of neural glutamate-transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1). The other molecular functions of addicsin, however, remain largely unknown. We analyzed here the regional and cellular distribution of addicsin transcript in the mature brain using in situ hybridization analysis, and examined the sequential addicsin mRNA expression levels in the developing brain using Northern blot analysis. In the mature brain, we found addicsin mRNA to be ubiquitously expressed in neuron-like cells, but not glial cells, in various brain regions including the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, addicsin mRNA was expressed in the neuron-like cells of the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layer and the interneuron-like cells of the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Addicsin transcripts were also extremely abundant in trigeminal neurons such as the principal trigeminal nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and motor trigeminal nucleus. Our evidence suggests that addicsin mRNA is chiefly expressed in the excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that addicsin may participate in the functional expression of the somatic sensory system by modulation of EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport. Northern blot analysis revealed that addicsin mRNA levels increased with maturation, reaching their maximum level at postnatal day 5 (P5), then significantly declined by about 50% until P14, suggesting that addicsin may contribute to embryogenesis and synaptogenesis in the developing brain. Thus, addicsin may participate in multiple physiological functions in the developing and mature brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using autoradiographic binding methodology with monoiodinated peptide YY together with the agonists neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPY (13-36), as well as in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes complementary to the NPY Y2 receptor (Y2-R) mRNA, we have studied whether or not intracerebral prion inoculation affects Y2-Rs in male CD-1 mice. Monoiodinated peptide YY binding, mainly representing Y2-Rs, was down-regulated by 85% in the CA1 strata oriens and radiatum and by 50-65% in the CA3 stratum oriens 110-140 days postinoculation. In the CA3 stratum radiatum, where the mossy fibers from the dentate granule cells project, there was a significant decrease in PYY binding at 110-120 days. Y2-R mRNA, moderately expressed both in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers and the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus, showed a slight, but not significant, decrease in CA3 neurons 130 days postinoculation. The results indicate that the accumulation of the scrapie prion protein in the CA1-3 region strongly inhibits NPY binding at the Y2-Rs, which, however, is only marginally due to reduced Y2-R mRNA expression. The loss of the ability of NPY to bind to inhibitory Y2-Rs may cause dysfunction of hippocampal circuits and may contribute to the clinical symptoms in mouse scrapie.',\n",

The distribution of the VIP2 receptor overlaps only in part with that of the VIP1 receptor, for example in the hippocampus, where VIP2 receptor messenger RNA was found in the pyramidal cells of the CA1-CA3 subfields and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Small numbers of neurons containing high concentrations of VIP2 receptor messenger RNA were present in the brainstem in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, suggesting a role for the VIP2 receptor in the processing of sensory information. The presence of the VIP2 receptor in the suprachiasmatic nucleus suggests that it is this receptor subtype which is involved in the control of circadian rhythms.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Kainic acid-mediated increase of preprotachykinin-A messenger RNA expression in the rat hippocampus and a region-selective attenuation by dexamethasone.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus contains the highest number of glucocorticoid-sensitive neurons in the rat brain and excessive exposure to glucocorticoids can cause damage to hippocampal neurons and impair the capacity of the hippocampus to survive neuronal insults. In this study in situ hybridization combined with quantitative image analysis was used to study preprotachykinin-A mRNA levels after administration of a toxic dose of kainic acid in animals pretreated with glucocorticoids. Kainic acid was injected into dorsal hippocampus CA3 region in animals pretreated with the synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone and in control animals. Preprotachykinin-A mRNA was not detected in the hippocampus of untreated animals or in animals analysed 30 min after a kainic acid injection. However, 4 h after injection of kainic acid, the level of preprotachykinin-A mRNA increased to 20-times above the detection limit both in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Treatment of kainic acid-injected animals with dexamethasone 30 min before and 2 h after the injection attenuated the increase in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus by 50%. In contrast, dexamethasone pretreatment had no significant effect on the kainic acid-induced increase of preprotachykinin-A mRNA in pyramidal cells in regions CA3 or CA1. These results show that an excitatory stimulus within the hippocampus causes a substantial increase in the level of preprotachykinin-A mRNA in hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells and suggest that in granule cells of the dentate gyrus this increase can be modulated by glucocorticoids.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Androgens modulate glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, but not mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA levels, in the rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Androgen, mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (AR, MR and GR, respectively) are ligand-activated transcription factors that alter gene expression and have a wide variety of effects in the central nervous system. High levels of AR, MR and GR mRNA have been found in the CA1 pyramidal cell region of the rat hippocampus and all 3 of these proteins bind to a similar hormone response element in DNA suggesting the possibility of common receptor function or cross-talk between these receptors at the level of transcription. To begin to investigate this hypothesis, we examined the regulation of AR, MR and GR mRNA expression in the rat hippocampus following treatment with androgens in combination with gonadectomy and/or adrenalectomy. Three-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were either castrated for 3 weeks, castrated and immediately implanted with 2 Silastic capsules filled with the non-aromatizable androgen, dihydrotestosterone, or left gonadally intact. Four days prior to sacrifice, these animals were either adrenalectomized or sham operated. GR, MR and AR mRNA were measured in the hippocampal subfields using in situ hybridization. In the CA1 region, dihydrotestosterone treatment of castrates decreased GR mRNA levels to 69 percent of levels found in gonadally intact rats and prevented the adrenalectomy-induced increases in GR mRNA observed in the gonadally intact and castrated animals. No changes in GR mRNA were observed in the CA3 region or dentate gyrus, where AR expression is low or absent. There was no effect of androgen treatment on MR mRNA levels nor did gonadectomy or androgen replacement alter the increases in MR mRNA following adrenalectomy. AR mRNA levels in the CA1 region were unchanged across all treatment groups. In vitro binding studies revealed almost complete nuclear occupancy of hippocampal AR in dihydrotestosterone-treated castrates. No appreciable in vitro binding of dihydrotestosterone to hippocampal MR or GR (Ki approximately 1500 nM) was observed which suggests that androgen regulation of GR mRNA in the hippocampus is occurring through AR binding. These data demonstrate a functional similarity of androgens and glucocorticoids in the regulation of GR mRNA levels in an area where AR and GR are colocalized. Androgen-mediated downregulation of GR expression may prove to be an important event in the adaptive responses of CA1 pyramidal cells to hormonal stimuli.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Spatiotemporal distribution of gp130 cytokines and their receptors after status epilepticus: comparison with neuronal degeneration and microglial activation.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Although numerous studies have demonstrated the neurotrophic capacity of gp130 cytokines, it remains unclear whether endogenously expressed cytokines actually function in a direct neuromodulatory manner. Therefore, using the lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus model, we performed a detailed in situ hybridization time-course study of five gp130 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], IL-11, oncostatin-m [OSM], and ciliary neurotrophic factor), gp130, and the receptors of the cytokines we found to be induced (IL-6 receptor [IL-6R], LIF receptor [LIF-R], and IL-11 receptor [IL-11R]). Additionally, to further understand the regulation of these cytokines, we compared their expression with the pattern of neuronal degeneration and microglial activation. Under control conditions, all cytokines, except LIF, exhibited faint to moderate expression in hippocampal principal layers. After seizure, IL-6, LIF, and IL-11 exhibited a rapid, robust, and transient upregulation in non-principal cells. LIF also exhibited a remarkably early and transient induction in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. OSM exhibited only a mild and inconsistent induction. All receptors examined were strongly expressed only in hippocampal principal layers under control conditions. A mild and late induction of the IL-6R, LIF-R, and IL-11R occurred after seizure with a scattered distribution. A progressive and chronic induction of gp130 was observed in cells that appeared to be associated with blood vessels. Degeneration of hilar interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cells was early and progressive. Granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, however, exhibited a delayed and precipitous pattern of degeneration, specifically in the lateral portion of the superior blade. Microglial activation was maximal 24-48 h post-seizure. We speculate that gp130 cytokines play a paracrine, neuromodulatory role in the hippocampus since both before and after seizure, principal cells appear to be the major cell type expressing the receptors for these cytokines. Furthermore, we suggest that activity-dependent mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of cytokines expressed early, and that relatively late occurring cytokine expression may be elicited by injury-related stimuli.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of the receptor protein-tyrosine kinases Tyro-3, Axl, and mer in the developing rat central nervous system.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer are three related receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) characterized by an extracellular domain exhibiting significant amino acid sequence similarity to neural cell adhesion molecules. The molecule Gas6 (for growth arrest-specific gene-6) has been shown to activate each of these receptors. Gas6 is expressed extensively in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that interactions between Gas6 and its receptors are likely to have physiologically relevant functions. To identify and localize the relevant Gas6/RPTK pairs, we have characterized the developmental expression of Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer in rat CNS using blotting and mRNA in situ hybridization analyses. Throughout development, Tyro-3 was the most widely expressed of the three receptors in the CNS, with Axl and Mer detected in only a limited number of sites in the adult. Tyro-3 expression was low in the embryo and increased markedly during early postnatal stages, with a time course paralleling that of synaptogenesis. Axl and Mer were expressed at low but relatively constant levels throughout development. In the cerebellum, all three receptors were found in Purkinje cells, and Tyro-3 was also detected in both granule neurons and Bergmann glia. Insofar as Gas6 has been previously shown to also be expressed by Purkinje cells, it may be engaged in both autocrine and paracrine signaling. The three receptors were also detected in cerebellar white matter, primarily during myelination. In the cortex, Tyro-3 was expressed at high levels during postnatal development and in the adult. Beginning at P6 in the hippocampus, Tyro-3 was expressed at high levels in CA1 pyramidal neurons and at lower levels in CA3 and was not detected in dentate granule neurons. Axl and Mer were found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and were absent from the pyramidal and dentate granule neurons. In that Gas6 is expressed throughout the pyramidal cell layer, it may activate these cells in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner. These studies provide initial clues for elucidating the cellular functions of the Axl subfamily members and suggest potential complex Gas6/RPTK as well as RPTK/RPTK signaling interactions in the mature and developing CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive dementia characterized by pronounced degeneration of certain populations of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the brain. One theory is that glutamate receptor-mediated toxicity plays a role in cell loss associated with Alzheimer's disease. We used in situ hybridization to examine GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 messengerRNAs (encoding alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid/kainate receptor subunits) in sections of autopsy samples of Alzheimer's disease brains and age-, sex-, and post-mortem delay-matched brains from non-demented (control) subjects. GluR1 and GluR2 exhibited a heterogeneous distribution in control brain. GluR1 was expressed in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, in pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields and in neurons of the subiculum and entorhinal cortex. GluR2 mRNA was at high density in the dentate gyrus and in CA3, but was at low density in CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. GluR3 hybridization was at very low levels but selectively localized to the dentate gyrus and CA3. In cerebellum, GluR1 was found in granule and Purkinje cell layers. In sections from Alzheimer's disease brain, a high degree of intersubject variability was observed: some samples showed markedly reduced GluR1 mRNA levels in dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 relative to controls; others showed no changes. Microscopic observation of emulsion-dipped sections revealed that the reduction of GluR1 seen in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of some Alzheimer's disease subjects was not due to cell loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Ref-1 protein is a bifunctional nuclear enzyme involved in repair of DNA lesions and in redox regulation of DNA-binding activity of AP-1 family members, such as Fos and Jun transcription factors. In the present study, we demonstrate by in situ hybridization that transient global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest activates ref-1 mRNA expression in the granular cells of the rat dentate gyrus after 6 h and in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus proper after 24 h, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear accumulation of Ref-1 protein in granular cells of the ischemia-resistant dentate gyrus, whereas Ref-1 protein expression progressively decreased in vulnerable CA1 neurons of the post-ischemic hippocampus from 24 h onwards. At the same time point, intense nuclear c-Jun immunoreactivity was observed in both neuronal cell populations. Our data suggest that oxidative stress induced by ischemia-reperfusion may increase neuronal ref-1 expression. However, inability of ref-1 mRNA translation and nuclear translocation of encoded protein in CA1 pyramidal neurons may inhibit repair of oxidative DNA damage or cellular adaptive responses leading to delayed neuronal cell death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effect of prolonged benzodiazepine administration on GABA(A) receptor subunit (alpha1-6, beta1-3, gamma2) messenger RNAs was investigated in the rat hippocampus and cortex, among other brain areas. Rats were orally administered flurazepam for one week, a protocol which results in benzodiazepine anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo, and in the hippocampus in vitro, in the absence of behavioral signs of withdrawal. Autoradiographs of brain sections, hybridized with [35S]oligoprobes in situ, were examined immediately (day 0) or two days after drug treatment, when rats were tolerant, or seven days after treatment, when tolerance had reversed, and were compared to sections from pair-handled, vehicle-treated controls. Alpha1 subunit messenger RNA level was significantly decreased in CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells at day 0, an effect which persisted only in CA1 neurons. Decreased \"alpha1-specific\" silver grain density over a subclass of interneurons at the pyramidal cell border suggested concomitant regulation of interneuron GABA(A) receptors. A reduction in beta3 subunit messenger RNA levels was more widespread among hippocampal cell groups (CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus), immediately and two days after treatment, and was also detected in the frontal and parieto-occipital cortices. Changes in beta2 subunit messenger RNA levels in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus cells two days after ending flurazepam treatment suggested a concomitant up-regulation of beta2 messenger RNA. There was a trend toward an increased level of alpha5, beta3 and gamma2 subunit messenger RNAs in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus cells, which was significant for the beta3 and gamma2 subunit messenger RNAs in the frontal cortex seven days after ending flurazepam treatment. There were no flurazepam treatment-induced changes in any other GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs. The messenger RNA levels of three (alpha1, beta2 and beta3) of nine GABA(A) receptor subunits were discretely regulated as a function of time after ending one-week flurazepam treatment related to the presence of anticonvulsant tolerance, but not dependence. The findings suggested that a localized switch in the subunit composition of GABA(A) receptor subtypes involving these specific subunits may represent a minimal requirement for the changes in GABA(A) receptor-mediated function recorded previously at hippocampal CA1 GABAergic synapses, associated with benzodiazepine anticonvulsant tolerance.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'After a spatial behavioral experience, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells express the activity-regulated, immediate early gene Arc in an environment-specific manner, and in similar proportions ( 40%) to cells exhibiting electrophysiologically recorded place fields under similar conditions. Theoretical accounts of the function of the fascia dentata suggest that it plays a role in pattern separation during encoding. The hypothesis that the dentate gyrus (DG) uses a sparse, and thus more orthogonal, coding scheme has been supported by the observation that, while granule cells do exhibit place fields, most are silent in a given environment. To quantify the degree of sparsity of DG coding and its corresponding ability to generate distinct environmental representations, behaviorally induced Arc expression was assessed using in situ hybridization coupled with confocal microscopy. The proportion of Arc(+) cells in the \"upper blade\" of the fascia dentata (i.e., the portion that abuts CA1) increased in an environment-specific fashion, approximately 4-fold above cage-control activity, after behavioral exploration. Surprisingly, cells in the lower blade of the fascia dentata, which are capable of expressing Arc following electrical stimulation, exhibited virtually no behaviorally-induced Arc expression. This difference was confirmed using \"line scan\" analyses, which also revealed no patterns or gradients of activity along the upper blade of the DG. The expression of Arc in the upper blade was quantitatively similar after exploring familiar or novel environments. When animals explored two different environments, separated by 20 min, a new group of cells responded to the second environment, whereas two separated experiences in the same environment did not activate a new set of granular cells. Thus, granule cells generate distinct codes for different environments. These findings suggest differential contribution of upper and lower blade neurons to plastic networks and confirm the hypothesis that the DG uses sparse coding that may facilitate orthogonalization of information.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization of postmortem human brain tissue showed that constitutive heat-shock cognate 70 (hsc 70) mRNA was expressed in more than 50% of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal subfields. The ratio (%) of the hsc 70 mRNA-expressing neurons to the total neurons was significantly greater in CA3 and the hilus than in CA1 and CA2. The lower ratio in CA1 may be related to its vulnerability to various stresses. The ratio of hsc 70 mRNA-expressing neurons in CA1 was significantly greater in the older subjects than in the younger ones. This may reflect the up-regulated hsc 70 mRNA induction in response to a reduction in free hsc 70 because the binding of hsc 70 to aberrant proteins may be increased in aged persons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Activity-induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is negatively modulated by circulating adrenal steroids. The rat BDNF gene gives rise to four major transcript forms that each contain a unique 5' exon (I-IV) and a common 3' exon (V) that codes for BDNF protein. Exon-specific in situ hybridization was used to determine if adrenalectomy has differential effects on basal and activity-induced BDNF transcript expression in hippocampus. Adrenalectomy alone had only modest effects on BDNF mRNA levels with slight increases in exon III-containing mRNA with 7-10-day survival and in exon II-containing mRNA with 30-days survival. In the dentate gyrus granule cells, adrenalectomy markedly potentiated increases in exon I and II cRNA labeling, but not increases in exon III and IV cRNA labeling, elicited by one hippocampal afterdischarge. Similarly, for the granule cells and CA1 pyramidal cells, hilus lesion (HL)-induced recurrent limbic seizures elicited greater increases in exon I and II cRNA hybridization in adrenalectomized (ADX) as compared to adrenal-intact rats. In this paradigm, adrenalectomy modestly potentiated the increase in exon III-containing mRNA in CA1 but had no effect on exon IV-containing mRNA content. These results demonstrate that the negative effects of adrenal hormones on activity-induced BDNF expression are by far the greatest for transcripts containing exons I and II. Together with evidence for region-specific transcript expression, these results suggest that the effects of stress on adaptive changes in BDNF signalling will be greatest for neurons that predominantly express transcripts I and II.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To investigate the changes underlying kindling epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus, the levels of the messenger RNAs encoding for the subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (1, 2A-D) and the kainate-receptor (1, -2, GluR-5, -6, -7) were determined in hippocampal principal neurons using in situ hybridization techniques and semi-quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms. Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway kindled rats were investigated at three different stages of kindling acquisition, always 24 h after the last stimulation. Furthermore, fully kindled rats were studied at long-term (28 days) after termination of kindling stimulations. NR1 messenger RNA levels were slightly decreased in CA1 area of fully kindled animals. In the fascia dentata region, a minor increase of NR2A and NR2B transcripts was found at all stages of kindling acquisition. KA-2 messenger RNA was enhanced in all hippocampal subfields during kindling development. However, none of these changes persisted at long-term after the last seizure and only the low-abundant GluR-7 expression was slightly depressed in the fascia dentata. From our observations we conclude that it is unlikely that alterations in N-methyl-Daspartate or kainate receptor gene expression play an important role in kindling acquisition or maintenance.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression and distribution of mRNA encoding preproatrial natriuretic peptide (ppANP) in rat brain has been investigated by in situ hybridization of two 35S-labeled synthetic DNA oligonucleotides, based on a cDNA clone sequence that encodes rat ppANP. The highest relative concentrations of ppANP mRNA were detected in the medial preoptic hypothalamic nucleus (\"anteroventral/third ventricle region\") and the medial habenula. Moderate concentrations of ppANP mRNA were observed in the CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the endopiriform nucleus, the arcuate nucleus, the zona incerta, and cells of the pontine tegmental and peduculopontine nuclei. Several of these regions, including the habenula and the hypothalamic areas, have previously been reported to contain atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-like immunoreactivity, but the expression of ppANP mRNA in CA1 pyramidal cells suggests the occurrence of differential translation of ppANP mRNA into protein product in different brain regions, or the existence of different immunological forms of the peptide. The abundance of ppANP mRNA in brain was relatively low in comparison with that previously reported for many other mRNA species encoding other brain neuropeptides. These results demonstrate that ANP gene expression occurs in discrete neuronal populations of the CNS and that studies of the regulation of this expression should now be possible using quantitative in situ hybridization.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Estradiol treatment increases the number of NMDA receptor binding sites, and changes evoked synaptic currents in a manner consistent with a steroid-induced functional enhancement of NMDA receptors in rat hippocampus. In this study, we investigate the cellular mechanisms of estradiol-induced NMDA receptor regulation at the protein and mRNA levels in ovariectomized rats treated with ovarian steroids using immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization techniques. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to quantify alterations in immunofluorescence intensity levels of NMDAR1 subunit proteins within neuronal somata and dendrites of discrete hippocampal fields, whereas in parallel, in situ hybridization was used to examine NMDAR1 mRNA levels in corresponding hippocampal regions. The data indicate that estradiol treatment in ovariectomized rats significantly increases immunofluorescence intensity levels in comparison with nonsteroid treated ovariectomized rats within the somata and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and, to a lesser extent, within the granule cell somata of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, such alterations in immunofluorescence intensity occur without concomitant changes in mRNA hybridization levels. Thus, these data suggest that estradiol modulates NMDA receptor function via post-transcriptional regulation of the NMDAR1 subunit protein. The increase in immunofluorescence intensity may reflect an increase in the concentration of the subunit protein, which could account for estrogen-induced changes in pharmacological and physiological properties of the NMDA receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Injection of the antimitotic drug methylazoxymethanol (MAM) in the pregnant rat at E14 leads in the offsprings to a severe malformation with microcephaly and cortical heterotopiae in the white matter and in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. These animals suffer cognitive and epileptic disorders. Since these pathologies have been associated with glutamatergic transmission abnormalities, we have examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry the distribution and expression levels of several glutamate receptors subunits in these rats. Examination of the GluR2 flip and flop, NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunit gene transcripts showed a qualitatively similar distribution in both the neocortex and hippocampus of MAM and control rats. Quantitative analysis revealed an altered proportion of the GluR2 flip and flop subunits in the CA1 region of MAM animals as compared to controls. Moreover, a 26% reduction in the expression of the NR1 subunit and a 40% increase in the expression of the GluR2 flip subunit were noted in cortical heterotopiae, as compared to the adjacent neocortex. Immunostaining for GluR2/3, NR1 or NR2 showed, in both MAM and control animals, that glutamate receptors were mainly concentrated in the soma and dendrites of neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells, including in heterotopiae, and in the apical dendrites of hippocampal granule cells. Abnormalities in the expression of glutamate receptor subtypes in cortical heterotopiae and in the hippocampal CA1 region could contribute to functional disorders previously reported in MAM animals such as memory impairments and epilepsy.

       "  'Title': 'Induction of F1/GAP-43 gene expression in hippocampal granule cells after seizures [corrected].',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In the adult rat hippocampus mRNA of F1/GAP-43, an axonal growth-associated protein, is highly expressed in pyramidal cells, but is absent in granule cells. To determine whether granule cells can be induced to express mRNA of F1/GAP-43, transcript levels were studied after limbic seizures, which can induce sprouting of granule cell mossy fibers. Seizure-inducing electrolytic lesions were made in the dentate gyrus hilus with stainless-steel electrodes and mRNA levels were measured in contralateral hippocampus by quantitative in situ hybridization. Induction of F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression was observed in granule cells at 24 h, but not at 6 or 12 h, after the hilar lesion. When equivalent sized hilar lesions were made with platinum electrodes, which do not induce seizures, no hybridization was apparent over the granule cells. Hybridization over granule cells had declined by 48 h post-lesion, but even at 10 days it was still slightly higher than in control rats. F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression was also increased 2-fold in CA1 pyramidal cells with peak expression at 48 h post-lesion. These are the first data to our knowledge that demonstrate that F1/GAP-43 gene expression can be altered in neurons located within the adult brain. Induction of F1/GAP-43 mRNA expression in the granule cells may be important for the sprouting of mossy fibers and could be triggered by the elevated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in CA3 cells which precede the increased F1/GAP-43 gene expression in granule cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-Copine is a novel protein with two C2 domains. Its expression is brain specific and up-regulated by neuronal activity such as kainate stimulation and tetanus stimulation evoking hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation. We examined the localization and subcellular distribution of N-copine in mouse brain. In situ hybridization analysis showed that N-copine mRNA was expressed exclusively in neurons of the hippocampus and in the main and accessory olfactory bulb, where various forms of synaptic plasticity and memory formation are known to occur. In immunohistochemical analyses, N-copine was detected mainly in the cell bodies and dendrites in the neurons, whereas presynaptic proteins such as synaptotagmin I and rab3A were detected in the regions where axons pass through. In fractionation experiments of brain homogenate, N-copine was associated with the membrane fraction in the presence of Ca2+ but not in its absence. As a GST-fusion protein with the second C2 domain of N-copine showed Ca2+-dependent binding to phosphatidylserine, this domain was considered to be responsible for the Ca2+-dependent association of N-copine with the membrane. Thus, N-copine may have a role as a Ca2+ sensor in postsynaptic events, in contrast to the known roles of \"double C2 domain-containing proteins,\" including synaptotagmin I, in presynaptic events.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We report that stimulation inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus evokes significant increases in both BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs in CA1 neurons. No changes in BDNF or NT-3 mRNA levels were seen in the nonstimulated regions of the pyramidal cell layer or the dentate. No change was seen in the levels of NGF mRNA at the time point examined. These results suggest that relatively normal levels of activity may regulate region-specific neurotrophin levels in the hippocampus. Given that known effects of NGF (and presumably of BDNF and NT-3) include elevation of neurotransmitter levels, elevation of sodium channels, and promotion of axonal terminal sprouting, activity-associated changes in neurotrophin levels may play a role in regulating neural connections in the adult as well as the developing nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Interleukin 3 prevents delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 field.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"In the central nervous system, interleukin (IL)-3 has been shown to exert a trophic action only on septal cholinergic neurons in vitro and in vivo, but a widespread distribution of IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) in the brain does not conform to such a selective central action of the ligand. Moreover, the mechanism(s) underlying the neurotrophic action of IL-3 has not been elucidated, although an erythroleukemic cell line is known to enter apoptosis after IL-3 starvation possibly due to a rapid decrease in Bcl-2 expression. This in vivo study focused on whether IL-3 rescued noncholinergic hippocampal neurons from lethal ischemic damage by modulating the expression of Bcl-xL, a Bcl-2 family protein produced in the mature brain. 7-d IL-3 infusion into the lateral ventricle of gerbils with transient forebrain ischemia prevented significantly hippocampal CA1 neuron death and ischemia-induced learning disability. TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling) staining revealed that IL-3 infusion caused a significant reduction in the number of CA1 neurons exhibiting DNA fragmentation 7 d after ischemia. The neuroprotective action of IL-3 appeared to be mediated by a postischemic transient upregulation of the IL-3R alpha subunit in the hippocampal CA1 field where IL-3Ralpha was barely detectable under normal conditions. In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that Bcl-xL mRNA expression, even though upregulated transiently in CA1 pyramidal neurons after ischemia, did not lead to the production of Bcl-xL protein in ischemic gerbils infused with vehicle. However, IL-3 infusion prevented the decrease in Bcl-xL protein expression in the CA1 field of ischemic gerbils. Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that IL-3 induced the expression of Bcl-xL mRNA and protein in cultured neurons with IL-3Ralpha and attenuated neuronal damage caused by a free radical-producing agent FeSO4. These findings suggest that IL-3 prevents delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 field through a receptor-mediated expression of Bcl-xL protein, which is known to facilitate neuron survival. Since IL-3Ralpha in the hippocampal CA1 region, even though upregulated in response to ischemic insult, is much less intensely expressed than that in the CA3 region tolerant to ischemia, the paucity of IL-3R interacting with the ligand may account for the vulnerability of CA1 neurons to ischemia.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Temporal changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA and [3H]PK11195 binding in relation to imidazoline-I2-receptor and alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding in the hippocampus following transient global forebrain ischaemia in the rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that following global forebrain ischaemia the selective neuronal loss that occurs in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus is accompanied by a reactive astrocytosis, characterized by increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein, and activation of microglia. In this study the spatial changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA levels in the hippocampus have been mapped four, eight, 12, 16 and 20 days following 10 min of global forebrain ischaemia in the rat and related to changes in [3H]PK11195 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, a putative marker of activated microglia. Recent studies have suggested that the imidazoline-I2-receptor, one of a class of non-adrenergic receptors related to, but structurally and functionally distinct from alpha 2-adrenoceptors, may have a functional role in controlling the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein. To explore this possibility further we have also mapped changes in imidazoline-I2-receptor and alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding sites. Following transient ischaemia there was a marked, biphasic increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA levels throughout the vulnerable CA1 region of the hippocampus, peaking four days after ischaemia and then increasing gradually during the remainder of the study period. There was also a sustained increase in [3H]PK11195 binding, however, in contrast to the initial increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA levels that peaked four days after ischaemia the density of [3H]PK11195 binding increased rapidly in all strata of the CA1 region over the first eight days and then increased more slowly throughout days 12 to 20. Despite the marked increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA levels there was no concomitant alteration in imidazoline-I2-receptor binding sites detected using the specific radioligand, [3H]2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline, although alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding was decreased at eight days after ischaemia and did not recover. The time-course and biphasic nature of the changes in the astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA, in the hippocampus following ischaemia may reflect different functions of glial fibrillary acidic protein-reactive astrocytes in the post-ischaemic period. Differences in temporal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA and [3H]PK11195 binding support the proposed localization of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on activated microglia, as distinct from reactive astrocytes. There was no evidence in the present study that imidazoline-I2-receptors are functionally linked to glial fibrillary acidic protein expression as the reactive astrocytosis in the hippocampus following ischaemia was not associated with changes in imidazoline-I2-receptor binding site density.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The postsynaptic AMPA/kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate-selective glutamate receptors are formed by several different subunits and the overall subunit composition of the receptor appears to determine its physiological and pharmacological properties. Although glutamatergic mechanisms have been implicated in various forms of hippocampal stress responses, the impact of stress on glutamate receptor subunit composition has not yet been elucidated. We have used cell-by-cell quantitative in situ hybridization to assess stress-induced changes in transcript levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate and AMPA receptor subunit genes in subdivisions of the rat hippocampus and hypothalamus that are implicated in the stress response. We found that 24 h after a single immobilization stress there was a significant increase in the cellular level of NR1 subunit messenger RNA (about 35-45% above control values) in hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells as well as in neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Moreover, in the CA3 area we have detected a concomitant increase (50% above controls) in the level of NR2B subunit messenger RNA, while the expression of NR2A subunit gene did not change after stress. Stress induced a selective decrease in the level of AMPA receptor subunit glutamate receptor A messenger RNA in neurons of both the CA3 and CA1 areas (18 and 24%, respectively, below control values). These results suggest that the regulation of specific subunit messenger RNAs of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and AMPA receptors may be involved in altered hippocampal and hypothalamic responsiveness to glutamate and thus could play a critical role in stress-induced changes in their function.',\n",

Normal function depends on precise interactions between the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus. To determine whether estradiol and progesterone interact with GABAergic neurons, the levels of mRNA for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for GABA synthesis, were measured by in situ hybridization histochemistry with 35S-labeled riboprobes complimentary to the feline GAD cDNA. The levels of mRNA for GAD were analyzed in selected region of the dorsal hippocampus and medial basal hypothalamus in ovariectomized, ovariectomized estradiol-treated, and ovariectomized estradiol- and progesterone-treated rats. In estradiol-treated rats, GAD mRNA levels increased in GABAergic neurons associated with the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, but not in the stratum oriens of CA1 or any other region of the hippocampus. Estradiol plus progesterone treatment reversed the estradiol-induced increase in GAD mRNA in CA1 and induced a small decrease in the hilus. No effect of estradiol or progesterone was observed in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, or arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus. Estradiol or progesterone may alter cognitive performance and seizure activity by increasing or decreasing, respectively, the activity of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synapsin I is the best characterized member of a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins thought to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. In this report, we present the first extensive in situ hybridization study detailing the regional and cellular distribution of synapsin I mRNA in the adult rat brain. Both the regional distribution and relative levels of synapsin I mRNA established by in situ hybridization were confirmed by RNA blot analysis. Our data demonstrate the widespread yet regionally variable expression of synapsin I mRNA throughout the adult rat brain. The greatest abundance of synapsin I mRNA was found in the pyramidal neurons of the CA3 and CA4 fields of the hippocampus, and in the mitral and internal granular cell layers of the olfactory bulb. Other areas abundant in synapsin I mRNA were the layer II neurons of the piriform cortex and layer II and V neurons of the entorhinal cortex, the granule cell neurons of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal fields CA1 and CA2, and the cells of the parasubiculum. In general, the pattern of expression of synapsin I mRNA paralleled those encoding other synaptic terminal-specific proteins, such as synaptophysin, VAMP-2, and SNAP-25, with noteworthy exceptions. To determine specifically how synapsin I mRNA levels are related to levels of synapsin I protein, we examined in detail the local distribution patterns of both synapsin I mRNA and protein in the rat hippocampus. These data revealed differential levels of expression of synapsin I mRNA and protein within defined synaptic circuits of the rat hippocampus.',\n",

We studied the expression of these receptors by in situ hybridization using specific [35S]-labeled riboprobes and by receptor autoradiography using [125I]Sarcosine1-angiotensin II. Angiotensin II receptor mRNA was found in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields, with the highest expression in the CA2 subfield, and in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Angiotensin II binding was detected in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the CA1 and CA2 subfields, in the stratum oriens of the CA3 subfield, and in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We then studied the effect of ischemia on hippocampal angiotensin II receptor expression, 1, 4 and 15 days after bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 5 min. No changes in angiotensin II receptor mRNA or binding were detected 1 day after ischemia. Delayed, progressive loss of angiotensin II mRNA and binding occurred 4 and 15 days after ischemia, in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields. The decline was faster in the CA1 subfield, and paralleled the loss of neurons after ischemia. In the dentate gyrus, angiotensin II receptor mRNA and angiotensin II binding were not changed when compared to sham operated controls. The decrease of angiotensin II receptor expression may reflect the loss of angiotensin II receptor-producing neurons rather than a down-regulation of receptor expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Hippocalcin is an EF-hand [Persechini A. et al. (1989) Trends Neurosci. 12, 462-467] Ca2+ binding protein encoded by a neuron-specific gene. A detailed atlas of hippocalcin messenger RNA expression in the adult rat brain was complied using in situ hybridization. Highest levels of messenger RNA are found in the hippocampus, where messenger RNA is localized in proximal dendrites of CA pyramidal cells. Expression is also seen in other brain regions, including the neocortex, caudate-putamen, taenia tecti, claustrum, olfactory tubercle, anterior olfactory nucleus, and granule cell and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb. The rat hippocalcin gene spans approximately 9 kb and consists of three exons, separated by introns of 6.7 and 0.25 kb. Sequence analysis of the putative proximal promoter region identified two clusters of multiple E-box sites which may regulate the cell-specific expression. Two lacZ fusion constructs carrying 0.9 and 3.4 kb of rat hippocalcin gene upstream region were used to create transgenic mice. With the 3.4 kb construct, transgene expression varied between founder mice, but was always found in the dentate gyrus and CA1-CA4 regions of the hippocampus, thus partly mimicking the expression of the endogenous gene. For the 0.9 kb construct, the levels of lacZ expression were weaker and more variable. Neither construct showed expression in any peripheral tissues examined. To establish an in vitro model of transcriptional regulation, the 3.4 and 0.9 kb 5' upstream regions were fused to a promoterless reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and transiently transfected into the hippocalcin-positive NG-108 cells. The 3.4 kb construct was strongly expressed, whilst the 0.9 kb construct was not expressed. In this paper, we describe the detailed expression pattern of the rat hippocalcin gene, the gene structure and its neuron-specific promoter.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have investigated by in situ hybridization changes in the content of mRNAs encoding for chromogranin B, secretogranin II, synaptin/synaptophysin and p65 after kainic acid-induced seizures and pentylenetetrazol kindling. Kainic acid seizures resulted in marked but transient increases in secretogranin II mRNA concentrations in the granule cell layer and throughout the pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus (by 100-500%) as well as in various areas of the cerebral cortex (by up to 900%) and the thalamus (up to 300%) 12 h after injection of the toxin. Chromogranin B mRNA concentrations were persistently increased in granule cells (but not in pyramidal cells) of the hippocampus (suprapyramidal blade, 450%) and in cortical areas (250%) at all time intervals after kainic acid injection (12 h to 60 days). Accordingly chromogranin B immunoreactivity was enhanced in the terminal field of mossy fibers and in the inner part of the molecular layer 30 days after kainic acid. Secretogranin II immunoreactivity was also markedly increased in CA1, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and in the central amygdala. In rats kindled with pentylenetetrazol only chromogranin B (by 200%) but not secretogranin II mRNA was increased in dentate granule cells. In contrast to the mRNAs of these secretory proteins concentrations of mRNAs encoding synaptin/synaptophysin and p65, two membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles, were not altered in any of these brain structures. These data demonstrate that in brain the biosynthesis of chromogranin B and secretogranin II is regulated like that of neuropeptides which is consistent with a role of these secretory polypeptides as precursors of functional peptides. Activation of neurons induces an increased synthesis of neuropeptides but not a concomitant synthesis of membrane proteins of synaptic vesicle. This might lead to an increased quantal content available for transmission.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effects of a very short ischemic insult on hilar somatostatin (SS) neurons were investigated in the gerbil hippocampus by means of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry. A selective and significant loss of 40% of hilar SS neurons took place after 1 day, and a 60% loss after 7 days following 2 min of ischemia, while no SS neurons were lost during recirculation after 1 min of ischemia. Repeated 2-min periods of ischemia, which induced ischemic tolerance by vulnerable CA1 neurons, caused almost complete loss of hilar SS neurons. This study clearly demonstrates that hilar SS neurons are more vulnerable to ischemic insult than CA1 pyramidal neurons. Ischemic tolerance may be induced during the progressive loss of SS neurons in the hilus by changes in their synaptic connections to CA1 pyramidal neurons.',\n",

The present quantitative study shows that GABAergic neurons containing high levels of GAD mRNA, express considerably more Gs alpha message than excitatory principal neurons, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cells of CA1 subfield. A subpopulation of basket cells of the dentate gyrus exhibited a uniquely high level of Gs alpha mRNA, in addition to GAD.

Coadministration of rolipram or Ro 20-1724 with an antidepressant (either desipramine or Org 4428) for 21 d resulted in a significant induction of BDNF mRNA in hippocampus relative to administration of vehicle. Coadministration of a PDE4 inhibitor with an antidepressant for 7 or 14 d also increased levels of BDNF mRNA. In contrast, acute coadministration did not influence levels of BDNF mRNA. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the induction of BDNF mRNA in response to the repeated coadministration paradigm occurs in the dentate gyrus granule and CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that coadministration shortens the time required for the upregulation of BDNF mRNA, supporting the possibility that this treatment may provide an effective therapy for major depression.',\n",

The levels of GAP-43 mRNA increased significantly in the CA3 pyramidal neurons and hilar polymorphic neurons of the dentate gyrus 2 days after stage 2 of kindling (preconvulsive stage) but not stage 5 (full seizure expression) in the stimulated hippocampus. The distribution of GAP-43 mRNA was the same in the hippocampus of kindled rats as in sham-stimulated animals. Preprosomatostatin mRNA and ppNPY mRNA contents rose significantly in the hilar polymorphic neurons of the dentate gyrus of the stimulated and contralateral hippocampus at both stages of kindling, with the greatest effect at stage 5. In addition, the number of ppNPY mRNA neurons in the fascia dentata was significantly higher in kindled rats than in controls, but there were no differences in the number of preprosomatostatin mRNA-positive cells. Preprosomatostatin and ppNPY mRNAs were also increased in the neurons of the stratum oriens of the CA1-CA3 subfield of fully kindled animals, whereas at stage 2 only neurons of the CA1 stratum oriens showed a significant increase of preprosomatostatin mRNA. No changes in preprosomatostatin and ppNPY mRNA expression were observed in the various regions of the hippocampus after a single afterdischarge or 1 month after stage 5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'mRNA encoding rat plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform PMCA3 was localized in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum and in choroid plexus by in situ hybridization with an 35S-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide probe. In order to examine whether this isoform is expressed as a protein in brain, polyclonal antibodies were raised against a peptide corresponding to a C-terminal 18 amino acid sequence of PMCA3 which had been conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Using immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified antibodies, PMCA3 protein was found in rat brain microsomes and cultured neurons. The translated protein had an observed molecular mass of approximately 135 kDa, as predicted from molecular cloning studies. The pattern of localization of PMCA3 in brain using anti-peptide antibodies was consistent with findings from in situ hybridization. PMCA3-like immunoreactive sites were found in the granule cell and molecular layers of rat cerebellum and in choroid plexus, and the pattern of staining suggests that immunoreactive sites are associated with granule cell processes. This conclusion was supported by the finding that growth-associated protein-43, a protein known to be present in axons and nerve terminals, had a pattern of distribution similar to PMCA3 in the molecular layer of cerebellum. Very low levels of PMCA3-like immunoreactivity were associated with Purkinje cell soma or processes, consistent with the low levels of PMCA3 mRNA found in these neurons. PMCA3-like immunoreactivity was lower in hippocampus than in cerebellum; hippocampal CA1 region immunoreactivity was primarily associated with dendritic fields rather than with pyramidal cell bodies. The results demonstrate that a PMCA3-like protein is expressed in neurons of rat brain and is localized primarily in cell processes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using in situ hybridization histochemistry neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression was investigated after intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA) and after local application of KA or quinolinic acid into the dentate gyrus of the rat. Enhanced concentrations of NPY mRNA were observed in interneurons of the hilus, including presumptive fusiform neurons and pyramidal-shaped basket cells already 4 hours after initiation of limbic seizures by KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Increased NPY expression persisted in neurons resistant to seizure-induced cell death (6-48 h after i.p. KA). Exceptionally high hybridization signals were found in interneurons of the hilus and the CA1 and CA3 sectors 8 months after KA-induced limbic seizures. In the granule cell layer only a transient but pronounced increase in NPY mRNA was observed 12-24 h after injection. Only moderate changes were observed in this cell layer at later intervals. Anticonvulsant treatment with thiopental, after a brief period of generalized seizures, prevented the increase in NPY mRNA in granule cells but not in interneurons. No change in NPY message was found also in granule cells of rats which responded with mild \"wet dog shake\" behavior but not with motor seizures to KA injection. Local injections of low doses of KA (0.05-0.2 nmol) or quinolinic acid (6.5-100 nmol) into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus under deep thiopental anesthesia, after 24 h, resulted in increased concentrations of NPY message in interneurons of the ipsilateral, but not of the contralateral hilus and not in granule cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have developed a method allowing suitable morphological conservation combined with in situ hybridization, on hippocampal slices used in conventional electrophysiological studies. After a bath application of kainate (KA, 750 nM, 2 min 15 s), electrical stimulation of the mossy fibre zone evoked epileptiform activity for up to 2 h. In situ hybridization performed on these slices showed a marked increased in expression of the transcription factor Zif/268 over the pyramidal and the granule cells and the surrounding neuropils. Bath application of tetraethylammonium (TEA, 25 mM, 10 min) elicited long-term potentiation in CA1 lasting up to 4 h. This was associated with enhanced expression of Zif/268 which returned to control values after 2 h 30 min. These observations suggest that slice preparations are suitable for the study of the role of neuronal activity in the regulation of gene expression.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'A detailed mapping of the histamine H(3) receptor and its gene transcripts in rat brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The detailed distribution of histamine H(3) receptor mRNAs in rat brain was analyzed by in situ hybridization using a 33P-labelled riboprobe and was combined for the first time with the detailed autoradiographic distribution of the receptor determined in the same animals with [(125)I]iodoproxyfan, a selective radioligand. The signals generated on adjacent brain sections by each probe were quantified and/or rated and were compared in order to identify neuronal populations expressing the receptor. In addition, the cellular localization of the transcripts within various brain structures was analyzed in sections dipped in a photographic emulsion. In the cerebral cortex, the strong mRNA expression in intermediate and deep layers indicates the presence of H(3) receptors on several types of neurons. The binding is dense except in layer V, suggesting that H(3) receptors are located on granule cells and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. In addition to their localization on monoaminergic afferents, the dense binding in layer IV and strong mRNA expression in thalamic nuclei suggest the presence of heteroreceptors on thalamocortical projections. In the hippocampus, the strong mRNA expression but low binding in pyramidal layers of the CA1 and ventral CA3 fields suggest that H(3) receptors are abundant on efferent projections of pyramidal cells. In the dentate gyrus, some binding sites in the molecular layer may correspond to H(3) receptors synthesized in granule cells and coexpressed with H(1) and H(2) receptors in their dendrites. In the basal ganglia, H(3) receptors are highly expressed in the striatal complex and olfactory tubercles but not in islands of Calleja. Some of the striatal binding sites may correspond to presynaptic receptors present on afferents. The mRNAs in cortical layer V may encode for heteroreceptors on corticostriatal neurons. The presence of mRNAs in the substantia nigra pars compacta suggests that H(3) receptors are located upon nigrostriatal afferents. However, the absence of any signal in the ventral tegmental area indicates that some but not all dopaminergic neurons express H(3) receptors. In addition, the homogeneous mRNA expression within the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens suggests that many striatal H(3) receptors are present on medium-sized, spiny projection neurons of both the direct and indirect movement pathways. In agreement, a dense binding, but low mRNA expression, is observed in external and internal pallidum and in substantia nigra pars reticulata. In the amygdala, the dense binding and mRNA expression indicate the presence of receptors on both afferents and projections. In the thalamus, the binding in some association nuclei may correspond to receptors present on neurons emanating from the deep cortical layers that strongly express the mRNAs, as well as receptors on the visual systems. However, the low binding and high mRNA expression in most nuclei indicate that many receptors are present upon thalamic projections. In the hypothalamus, the mRNA expression parallels the density of binding sites and is the highest in the tuberomammillary nucleus. Further investigation is needed to know if the dense binding and mRNA expression observed in other nuclei such as the paraventricular, ventromedial and medial tuberal nuclei correspond to pre- and/or postsynaptic receptors. mRNAs are also observed in several areas projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus, such as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. In the lower brainstem, the high mRNA expression and very low binding in the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei indicate that presynaptic rather than somatodendritic receptors regulate noradrenaline and serotonin release, respectively. A similar pattern in vestibular nuclei suggests that receptors located on projections account for the anti-vertigo properties of H(3) receptor antagonists. In the cerebellum, binding is hardly detectable but a strong mRNA expression is found in most, if not all, Purkinje cells as well as in several central cerebellar nuclei, suggesting the presence of H(3) receptors on efferent projections. The present study reports the first detailed quantification and/or rating of H(3) receptor mRNAs in the brain. The comparison, performed in the same animals, with the distribution of the H(3) receptor protein provides evidence for the presence of H(3) receptors on many neuronal perikarya, dendrites and projections. Although some localizations, mainly as auto- or heteroreceptors, are consistent with previous functional studies, the physiological role, if any, of most of these presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors remains to be established.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuronal death was produced in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform and entorhinal cortices after intraperitioneal administration of kainic acid at convulsant doses to adult rats. To assess the involvement of members of the Bcl-2 family in cell death or survival, immunohistochemistry, western and northern blotting to Bcl-2, Bcl-x and Bax, and in situ hybridization to Bax were examined at different time-points after kainic acid treatment. Members of the Bcl-2 family were expressed in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, and in a subset of neurons of the piriform and the entorhinal cortices, amygdala and neocortex in the normal adult brain. Dying neurons in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 and CA3 areas, entorhinal and piriform cortices, and amygdala also expressed Bcl-2, Bax and Bcl-x following excitotoxicity, although many dying cells did not. In addition, a number of cells in the affected areas showed Bax immunoreactivity in their nuclei at 24-48 h following kainic acid administration, thus indicating Bax nuclear translocation in a subset of dying cells. Western blots disclosed no modifications in the intensity of the bands corresponding to Bcl-2, Bcl-x and Bax, between control and kainic acid-treated rats. No modifications in the intensity of the bcl-2 messenger RNA band on northern blots was observed in kainic acid-treated rats. However, a progressive increase in the intensity of the bax messenger RNA band was found in kainic acid-treated rats at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h following kainic acid administration. Interestingly, a slight increase in Bax immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm of neurons of the dentate gyrus at 24-48 h, a feature which matches the increase of bax messenger RNA in the same area, as shown by in situ hybridization at 12-24 h following kainic acid injection. The present results suggest that cell death or survival does not correlate with modifications of Bcl-2, Bax and Bcl-x protein, and messenger RNA expression, but rather that kainic acid excitotoxicity is associated with Bax translocation to the nucleus in a subset of dying cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have studied the effect of intrahippocampal administration of quinolinic acid (QUIN) on the temporal expression of mRNAs encoding the immediate early genes (IEGs) c-fos and NGFI-A, by in situ hybridization histochemistry. After administration of QUIN to the left hippocampus, expression of mRNA of both IEGs was transiently stimulated. Maximal expression was found between 1 and 3 h. mRNA of both IEGs was simultaneously expressed in the ipsilateral and contralateral sides in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 and CA3 fields as well as in the cortex. After pretreatment with the non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 (2 mg/kg i.p. -30 min) the increased expression of both IEGs was partially prevented in the hippocampus and completely in the cortex. No inhibition was observed after treatment with the AMPA antagonist NBQX (30 mg/kg i.p. -15, -5 and +10 min). Additional delayed expression of both IEGs was observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus. This expression was related to cell damage. Twelve h after QUIN administration, c-fos and NGFI-A mRNAs were present in the dentate gyrus. After 4 days, only c-fos mRNA was observed in the dentate gyrus and CA1 field while no NGFI-A mRNA was detected. The present results show that the effect of QUIN is mediated by NMDA and not by AMPA receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Down Syndrome (DS) is a major cause of mental retardation and is associated with characteristic well-defined although subtle brain abnormalities, many of which arise after birth, with particular defects in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The neural cell adhesion molecule DSCAM (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) maps to 21q22.2-->q22.3, a region associated with DS mental retardation, and is expressed largely in the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems during development. In order to evaluate the contribution of DSCAM to postnatal morphogenetic and cognitive processes, we have analyzed the expression of the mouse DSCAM homolog, Dscam, in the adult mouse brain from 1 through 21 months of age. We have found that Dscam is widely expressed in the brain throughout adult life, with strongest levels in the cortex, the mitral and granular layers of the olfactory bulb, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cells of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions, the ventroposterior lateral nuclei of the thalamus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Dscam is also expressed ventrally in the adult spinal cord. Given the homology of DSCAM to cell adhesion molecules involved in development and synaptic plasticity, and its demonstrated role in axon guidance, we propose that DSCAM overexpression contributes not only to the structural defects seen in these regions of the DS brain, but also to the defects of learning and memory seen in adults with DS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Changes in nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA expression in the rat hippocampus following 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia were evaluated using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Twelve hours after the insult, the level of nerve growth factor messenger RNA increased markedly in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and by day 2 returned to control levels. The level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA showed a persistent and moderate increase. The highest expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA was seen in the dentate granule cells on day 2 after the insult, and then the expression returned to the control levels. At 2 days post-ischemia, contents of messenger RNAs for nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were reduced in the CA1 region, which may represent delayed loss of vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons. In contrast to brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor messenger RNA expression, the level of neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA declined in the CA1, the CA2 and the dentate granular layer immediately after ischemic insult. In the CA1 region, the reduced expression persisted for at least seven days, but in the dentate gyrus, neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA expression returned to the control levels after two days of post-ischemic recovery. These results suggest that nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 genes are differentially regulated and that each of their gene products may play different roles in the central nervous system under pathophysiological conditions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Global brain ischemia causes cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 3-5 days after reperfusion. The biological pathway leading to such delayed neuronal damage has not been established. By using differential display analysis, we examined expression levels of poly(A) RNAs isolated from hippocampal extracts prepared from rats exposed to global ischemia and found an up-regulated transcript, clone 17a. Northern blot analysis of clone 17a showed an approximately 35-fold increase in the ischemic brain at 24 h after four-vessel occlusion. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends of clone 17a revealed a family of genes (160-540 base pairs) that had the characteristics of rodent B(2) sequences. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the elevated expression of this gene was localized predominantly in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. The level of expression in the CA1 region decreased dramatically between 24 and 72 h after ischemia. The elevated expression of clone 17a was not observed in four-vessel occlusion rats treated with the compound LY231617, an antioxidant known to exert neuroprotection in rats subjected to global ischemia. Since delayed neuronal death has the characteristics of apoptosis, we speculate that clone 17a may be involved in apoptosis. We examined the expression level of clone 17a in in vitro models of apoptosis using cerebellar granule neurons that were subjected to potassium removal, glutamate toxicity, or 6-hydroxydopamine treatment and found that clone 17a transcripts were induced in cerebellar granule neurons by glutamate or 6-hydroxydopamine stimulation but not potassium withdrawal.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The distribution of cells containing copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD) protein and mRNA was studied in hippocampi from normal humans and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Using antisera against native and denatured CuZn SOD protein, we have determined that immunostaining was intense in pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis, in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and very weak in other cells. In the hippocampus of an Alzheimer's patient, successive immunostaining of the same tissue section by antiCuZn SOD and antipaired helical filaments antisera show that both normal and degenerating cells were labeled by the antiCuZn SOD antiserum. Thus, large pyramidal neurons which are susceptible to degenerative processes in AD have the property to contain high amount of CuZn SOD protein. In situ hybridization was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed hippocampus sections of normal human brains and AD brains with a 35 S labeled DNA probe homologous to human CuZn SOD mRNA. Our results show that CuZn SOD transcripts are present at high abundance in pyramidal neurons of the CA1-CA4 fields, subiculum, and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. This cellular distribution is similar to that obtained with the antiCuZn SOD antiserum. This might indicate that biochemical pathways leading to superoxide radicals generation are specially active in these neurons, requiring an active transcription of CuZn-SOD gene.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Substance P, which modulates synaptic excitability, can be induced by a variety of stimuli. We studied the expression of hippocampal substance P in rats in using lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus during development. Status epilepticus resulted in an age-specific manner of substance P expression that was anatomically distinctive in hippocampal subfields. Maximal induction of substance P immunoreactivity was seen in the CA1 region of the two-week-old rats, and progressively decreased in the three-, four-week-old rats and adults. Meanwhile, the number of substance P-immunoreactive neurons in the CA3 region and dentate granule cell layer was minimal in the two-week-old animals, but approximated the adult level in the three- and four-week-old rats. No substance P-immunoreactive axon terminals were seen in the strata pyramidale and lucidum in the CA3 region of the two-week-old rats, but they were found to progressively increase in the three-, four-week-old rats and adults. To confirm substance P expression after status epilepticus, we studied the expression of preprotachykinin-A mRNA in the hippocampus of the three-week-old rats by in situ hybridization. Two hours following injection of lithium-pilocarpine, preprotachykinin-A mRNA dramatically increased in the granule cells, as well as in the CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus. To evaluate the relationship between behavioral seizures and substance P induction, we used the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Injection of MK-801 completely blocked lithium-pilocarpine-induced behavioral seizures and SP induction in the two-week-old rats. These results indicate that seizure activity selectively evokes age-dependent and region-selective expression of substance P.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Short and long attack latency mice, which are selected based on their offensive behaviour in a resident-intruder model, differ in their neuroendocrine regulation as well as in aspects of their brain serotonin system. Previous studies showed that the binding capacity and expression of serotonin-1A receptors in the hippocampal CA1 field of long attack latency mice are significantly lower than that found in short attack latency mice. We tested whether the functional responses of CA1 hippocampal cells to serotonin are also reduced in long attack latency mice. To this end, serotonin-induced changes in the membrane potential and input resistance were recorded in vitro with microelectrodes in CA1 pyramidal neurones of long and short attack latency mice. The data show that in long attack latency mice, along with a reduction of the serotonin-1A receptor mRNA expression, the serotonin-induced membrane hyperpolarization and decrease in resistance are attenuated. Basal membrane properties of CA1 neurones in the two.mice lines were comparable. Plasma corticosterone levels in response to a novelty stress were elevated in long compared to short attack latency mice and inversely related to the serotonin-induced responses. We tentatively conclude that long attack latency mice show attenuated functional responses to serotonin in the hippocampus, possibly linked to a chronic perturbation of hormonal levels.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Seizures, neuropeptide regulation, and mRNA expression in the hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies have demonstrated that the regulation of neuropeptide expression in forebrain neurons is responsive to external influences including changes in physiological activity. This has been demonstrated most clearly in studies of hippocampus where the synthesis and resting levels of several neuropeptides, localized within well-characterized components of hippocampal circuitry, have been shown to be selectively influenced by seizure activity. In studies described here, we examined the influence of recurrent limbic seizures on the expression of enkephalin, dynorphin, cholecystokinin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in rat and mouse hippocampus using immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization and blot hybridization techniques. The data demonstrate that seizures differentially influence the expression of each peptide as a part of a broader cascade of changes in genomic expression within individual hippocampal neurons. In particular, seizures increase preproenkephalin mRNA and enkephalin peptide but decrease dynorphin peptide in the dentate gyrus granule cell/mossy fiber system. Seizure-induced decreases in the concentration of preprodynorphin mRNA in the granule cells have been reported by others. Immunoreactivity for CCK, which is codistributed with the opioid peptides in the mossy fiber system of mouse, is also dramatically reduced in the granule cell axons by seizure. Recurrent seizures induce two temporally distinct changes in NPY expression in hippocampus. First, there is an increase in hybridization to preproNPY mRNA within scattered, probable local circuit neurons in all subfields. This is followed by the seemingly novel appearance of preproNPY mRNA within the dentate gyrus granule cells and pyramidal cells of field CA1. Clues about mechanisms of neuropeptide regulation have come from observations of other, more rapid, transcriptional events induced by seizure. Most notably, our results and those of others demonstrate that seizures increase the expression of messenger RNAs from immediate-early genes (c-fos, c-jun, and NGFI-A) which encode proteins that may mediate neuropeptide gene regulation. In addition, mRNA for nerve growth factor is dramatically increased in the dentate gyrus granule cells by seizure; increased production of this trophic factor might mediate the more delayed changes in genomic expression and growth responses observed to occur in hippocampus and other forebrain areas following seizure activity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, is one of the most potent neurotrophic factors and promotes survival of many populations of cells. We examined neuroprotective effect of an adenoviral vector encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (AxCAhGDNF) on the transient global ischemia. Gerbils received administration of AxCAhGDNF or an adenoviral vector encoding bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (AxCALacZ) through the lateral ventricle. Two days later, occluding bilateral common carotid arteries for 5 min using aneurysm clips produced the transient global forebrain ischemia. Animals showed intense immunolabeling for GDNF in ependymal cells on 2, 4 and 7 days after the operation. The exogenous gene transducted by adenovirus in the same cells was detected by in situ hybridization. The treatment with AxCAhGDNF significantly prevented the loss of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons 2 to 7 days after the operation, as compared to AxCALacZ treatment. Also terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was markedly reduced in the case with AxCAhGDNF treatment at 7 days after the operation. These results indicated that the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of GDNF might prevent the delayed neuronal death of stroke and other disorders of the cerebral vasculature.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Transient global forebrain ischemia induces in rat brain a large increase of expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun and of the mRNAs for the 70-kDa heat-shock protein and for the form of the amyloid beta-protein precursor including the Kunitz-type protease-inhibitor domain. At 24 hr after ischemia, this increased expression is particularly observed in regions that are vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ischemia, such as pyramidal cells of the CA1 field in the hippocampus. In an attempt to find conditions which prevent the deleterious effects of ischemia, representatives of three different classes of K+ channel openers, (-)-cromakalim, nicorandil, and pinacidil, were administered both before ischemia and during the reperfusion period. This treatment totally blocked the ischemia-induced expression of the different genes. In addition it markedly protected neuronal cells against degeneration. The mechanism of the neuroprotective effects involves the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels since glipizide, a specific blocker of that type of channel, abolished the beneficial effects of K+ channel openers. The various classes of K+ channel openers seem to deserve attention as potential drugs for cerebral ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Adenosine A2a receptors are not confined to dopamine-rich areas of the brain, since thermocycling analysis shows that adenosine A2a receptor mRNA is expressed also in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus) and cerebral cortex. The expression of A2a mRNA in three main areas of the hippocampus was confirmed by in situ hybridization; A2a mRNA expression was mainly localized in the pyramidal and granular cells, the same hippocampal regions that showed adenosine A1 receptor mRNA expression. Receptor autoradiographic studies with [3H]CGS 21680 (30 nM), a selective adenosine A2a receptor agonist, showed specific binding sites in the hippocampus. The density of [3H]CGS 21680 binding was greatest in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 area, followed by the stratum oriens of the cornu Ammonis, stratum radiatum of the CA3 are and supra-granular layer of the dentate gyrus. This anatomical distribution of [3H]CGS 21680 binding was similar to the pattern of [3H]CHA binding in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological studies in the Schaffer fibers/CA1 pyramids showed that upon activation of the A2a receptors with CGS 21680 (10 nM) the ability of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist, CPA, to inhibit neuronal activity was significantly attenuated. These results show functionally important co-expression and co-localization of adenosine A2a and A1 receptors in the hippocampus. The results also suggest that adenosine A2a receptor-mediated neuromodulation is not confined to the basal ganglia, but is more widespread throughout the nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Knockdown of AMPA receptor GluR2 expression causes delayed neurodegeneration and increases damage by sublethal ischemia in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Considerable evidence suggests that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are critical mediators of the delayed, selective neuronal death associated with transient global ischemia and sustained seizures. Global ischemia suppresses mRNA and protein expression of the glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 and increases AMPA receptor-mediated Ca(2+) influx into vulnerable neurons of the hippocampal CA1 before the onset of neurodegeneration. Status epilepticus suppresses GluR2 mRNA and protein in CA3 before neurodegeneration in this region. To examine whether acute downregulation of the GluR2 subunit, even in the absence of a neurological insult, can cause neuronal cell death, we performed GluR2 \"knockdown\" experiments. Intracerebral injection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted to GluR2 mRNA induced delayed death of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3. Antisense-induced neurodegeneration was preceded by a reduction in GluR2 mRNA, as indicated by in situ hybridization, and in GluR2 protein, as indicated by Western blot analysis. GluR2 antisense suppressed GluR2 mRNA in the dentate gyrus but did not cause cell death. The AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxiline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and the Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor channel blocker 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine protected against antisense-induced cell death. This result indicates that antisense-induced cell death is mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. GluR2 antisense and brief sublethal global ischemia acted synergistically to cause degeneration of pyramidal neurons, consistent with action by a common mechanism. These findings demonstrate that downregulation of GluR2 is sufficient to induce delayed death of specific neuronal populations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) is an 18-kDa integral membrane protein required, in peripheral cells, for the activation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and for the resulting synthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. In the brain, the leukotrienes have been implicated in several pathophysiological events and in the electrophysiological effect of somatostatin, yet the cellular origin and role of these messenger molecules are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that 5-LO and FLAP are expressed in various regions of the rat brain, including hippocampus, cerebellum, primary olfactory cortex, superficial neocortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Highest levels of expression were observed in cerebellum and hippocampus. In the latter we demonstrate the colocalization of 5-LO and FLAP in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Moreover, electrophysiological experiments show that selective inhibition of FLAP with the compound MK-886 (0.25-1 microM) prevents the somatostatin-induced augmentation of the hippocampal K+ M-current. Our results provide necessary evidence for the presence and signaling role of 5-LO and FLAP in central neurons and strongly support their proposed participation in somatostatin-receptor transmembrane signaling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Presenilin-1 gene (PS1, s182) encoding a protein that contains seven transmembrane domains was recently identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mutations on this gene may contribute to pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we used in situ hybridization histochemistry to detect the expression of PS1 in neurons in the hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex of the rat brain. Specifically, mRNAs of PS1 were predominantly found in pyramidal neurons in CA1, CA3, and granule cells in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the external and internal pyramidal layers of the cerebral cortex. The same neuronal populations express the amyloid protein precursor (APP-695). Transgenic mice expressing a mutated APP-695 produced increased levels of beta-amyloid (A beta) and exhibited behavioral deficits. These results lead us to suggest that when PS1 and APP-695 colocalize in neurons in the brain, PS1 may play a regulatory role in production of (A beta) protein of AD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of the messenger RNAs encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits in neurologically normal post-mortem human brain was studied by in situ hybridization. In the caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens strong hybridization signals were observed for N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-1 messenger RNA but much weaker signals for N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-3 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4, N-Methyl-D-aspartate R1-2 was not detectable. N-methyl-D-aspartate R2B was the only N-methyl-D-aspartate R2 subunit detected in these nuclei. In the hippocampus the messenger RNAs for both N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4 were strongly expressed in the dentate gyrus, CA3-CA1 pyramidal cells, subiculum, entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Much lower expression was seen for N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-2 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-3. The messenger RNAs for both N-methyl-D-aspartate R2A and N-methyl-D-aspartate R2B, but not N-methyl-D-aspartate R2C, subunits were expressed in the hippocampus. In the temporal cortex all N-methyl-D-aspartate RI isoforms were expressed (N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4 being the most abundant) and N-methyl-D-aspartate R2A and N-methyl-D-aspartate R2B but not N-methyl-D-aspartate R2C were also moderately expressed. In the brain stem N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4 was strongly expressed in various nuclei including the locus coeruleus, nucleus centralis superior and deep pontine nuclei. Only weak expression was seen for N-methyl-D-aspartate RI-1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-3 but not N-methyl-D-aspartate RI-2; of the N-methyl-D-aspartate R2 subunits only N-methyl-D-aspartate R2C was found to be expressed in these nuclei. In the cerebellum all the N-methyl-D-aspartate I isoforms were expressed (mostly N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4) in the Purkinje layer which also expressed N-methyl-D-aspartate R2A and N-methyl-D-aspartate R2C. In the molecular layer cells were found expressing N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R2B and cells in the granule layer were found to express N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-1, N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-3 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1-4 and N-methyl-D-aspartate R2C only. Preliminary studies indicated that the messenger RNA for the N-methyl-D-aspartate R2D subunit was not expressed in the above areas of brain. These results give the first demonstration of the distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit messenger RNAs in the human brain. The region-specific expression of subunit combinations suggests a heterogeneity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors with diverse physiological/pathophysiological roles and provides a rationale for the development of discriminatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists to target selective neuronal populations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A search for genes differentially expressed in the rat striatum revealed a gene fragment with a ventral to dorsal striatal expression pattern. The sequence of the fragment was used to isolate mouse and rat clones that upon sequencing were identified as homologous to human guanine deaminase. Here we report the distribution of guanine deaminase in the rodent brain. In situ hybridization localization of the encoding mRNA showed a distribution primarily in forebrain areas including cortical pyramidal neurons, ventral striatal medium spiny neurons, hippocampal pyramidal neurons in CA3-CA1 and granule cells in the dentate gyrus, and neurons of the amygdala. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies raised against peptide fragments derived from the guanine deaminase protein sequence showed localization of guanine deaminase in areas predicted by the mRNA distribution. In addition to immunolabeling of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala there was also labeling in the terminal fields of these neurons including the thalamus, globus pallidum and substantia nigra. A functional histochemical assay that demonstrates the site of guanine deamination shows guanine deaminase activity in a pattern that matched the immunohistochemical localization. The cellular distribution of guanine deaminase to distal areas of the cell including terminals and dendrites was additionally demonstrated by the expression of recombinant guanine deaminase in transformed cortical neurons in culture. In summary we have described the isolation and characterization of mouse and rat guanine deaminase. The expression of guanine deaminase is primarily restricted to forebrain neurons. A histochemical assay was used to localize guanine deaminase activity to the dendrites and axons of neurons expressing guanine deaminase.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Deficiency in palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT) results in the rapid death of neocortical neurons in human. Very little is known about the developmental and cell-specific expression of this lysosomal enzyme. Here we show that PPT is expressed as a major 2.65 kb and a minor 1.85 kb transcript in the mouse brain. Transcript levels gradually increase between postnatal days 10 and 30. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that PPT transcripts are found widely but not homogeneously in the brain. The most intense signal was detected in the cerebral cortex (layers II, IV-V), hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal cells, dentate gyrus granule cells and the hypothalamus. Immunostaining of PPT was localized in the cell soma, axons and dendrites, especially in the pyramidal and granular cells of the hippocampus, correlating well, both spatially and temporally, with the immunoreactivity of a presynaptic vesicle membrane protein, synaptophysin. In whole embryos, at embryonic day 8, the PPT mRNA expression was most apparent throughout the neuroepithelium, and from day 9 onwards it was seen in all tissues. The expression pattern of PPT suggests its general significance for the brain cells and reflects the response to maturation and growth of the neural networks. Strong PPT immunoreactivity in the axons and dentrites would imply that PPT may not be exclusively a lysosomal enzyme. A notable correlation with synaptophysin would suggest that PPT may have a role in the function of the synaptic machinery.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The pore-forming alpha subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in neurons and other excitable cells are expressed in association with accessory beta subunits. These subunits both promote insertion of channel complexes into surface membranes and influence their electrophysiological properties. As part of an effort to understand the regulation of voltage-gated potassium channels during development, we cloned the mouse homolog of the rat Kvbeta1 potassium channel subunit. Kvbeta1 subunits are known to associate preferentially with Shaker (Kv1)-related alpha subunits. We then used a digoxigenin-tagged cRNA probe and in situ hybridization techniques to visualize the appearance of Kvbeta1 mRNA transcripts during late embryonic and early neonatal development of the mouse brain. We detected Kvbeta1-specific labeling of cells in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, colliculus, and cerebellum. In hippocampus, we observed Kvbeta1 mRNA in CA3 pyramidal neurons at the earliest time examined, embryonic day 16 (E16). Between E16 and postnatal day 7 (P7), cell labeling increased uniformly across the pyramidal neurons of Ammon's horn (CA1, CA2, and CA3). Subsequently, between P7 and P22, regional differences characteristic of mature hippocampus appeared-intense labeling of neurons in CA3 and CA1, and less in CA2. In cortex, labeling of cells in the subplate and cortical plate layers was observed at E16. During development, the intensity of this labeling increased, and labeled cells persisted into the adult stage in the deep cortical layer (VIb) formed from subplate neurons. Additional labeling of scattered solitary cells in cortical layers II-VIa emerged between P3 and P7 and was prominent in mature cortex. In caudate putamen, Kvbeta1-labeled cells were observed at P1 and were restricted to the lateral and rostral half of the caudate. During development, labeling expanded caudally and medially and eventually filled the mature caudate putamen. In colliculus, a small population of inferior colliculus cells showed labeling at P7, and additional labeling of scattered cells appeared during development. In superior colliculus, labeling was observed only in the adult deep gray layer. In cerebellum, intense labeling was observed in Purkinje cells at all stages between P1 and adult. Labeling was also seen in granule neurons in the external granule layer at early postnatal stages and in the inner granule layer beginning at P7.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Transient cerebral ischemia causes extensive cell death in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and selective loss of interneurons in the dentate hilus. Many hippocampal interneurons can be classified by their contents of somatostatin (SS) and/or neuropeptide Y (NPY). Following ischemia in the rat, most of the NPY immunoreactivity is permanently lost in hippocampus. Furthermore, SS interneurons in the dentate hilus die, whereas CA1 interneurons survive and their expression of SS mRNA and peptide returns to preischemic levels within 16 days after ischemia. We have addressed the following questions: (1) Does the loss of NPY involve a specific downregulation in surviving CA1 interneurons that pre-ischemically expressed both SS and NPY? (2) Can the subpopulation of dying interneurons in hilus be identified from their preischemic coexpression of SS and NPY? We investigated the coexpression of SS mRNA and NPY peptide using combined in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Cells containing one or both markers were counted in control sections and sections taken 2-16 days after ischemia from the hippocampal formation. In CA1, a decrease in the number of neurons containing NPY alone as well as a decrease in the number of neurons coexpressing NPY and SS was observed, whereas the number of neurons containing SS alone increased 16 days after ischemia. We conclude that neurons coexpressing SS and NPY before ischemia added to the number of neurons containing SS alone after ischemia, because NPY expression was selectively down regulated in the coexpressing population. In hilus, we demonstrated both survival and ischemic cell death of neurons expressing either SS, NPY or both, indicating that hilar interneurons dying from ischemia cannot unequivocally be identified from their preischemic colocalization of SS and NPY.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Electroconvulsive therapy is used in the treatment of affective disorders and schizophrenia and experimental electroconvulsive shock may serve as an animal model for this treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible role for neurotrophins in the mechanism of action of experimental electroconvulsive shock and thus in clinical electroconvulsive therapy. The effect of electroconvulsive shock on levels of messenger RNAs encoding the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the receptor trkB in rat hippocampus was determined by in situ hybridization with RNA probes 1, 3, 9 and 27 h following the shock. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels were increased at 1, 3 and 9 h following the shock and normalized after 27 h. Granule cells of the dentate gyrus showed a more rapid response as compared to hilar cells and pyramidal cells of CA1. Total trkB messenger RNA levels, including the transcripts for both the truncated and full length trkB receptor protein (gp95trkB and gp145trkB, respectively), showed a pattern of increase very similar to that of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA. However, using a probe selective for the full length (gp145trkB) trkB messenger RNA, we determined a delayed pattern of activation with significant increase only at 3 and 9 h after the shock. In hippocampus total trkB messenger RNA was found to consist of approximately one-quarter of mRNA encoding gp145trkB and three-quarters encoding gp95trkB as revealed by RNAase protection. While brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the truncated trkB messenger RNAs appear to increase with a similar pattern, suggesting a similar mechanism of activation by electroconvulsive shock, full length receptor trkB messenger RNA appears to increase with a delayed pattern suggesting a separate mechanism of activation. Electroconvulsive shock-induced seizures seem to include activation of a brain neurotrophin known to be important for neuronal plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Changes in expression of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters in rat hippocampus following kainate-induced seizure activity.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in rat hippocampus was studied following kainic acid-induced seizure activity in vivo and in hippocampal slice cultures. Protein and mRNA levels of the glial (EAAT2) and neuronal (EAAT3) transporters were determined with affinity-purified antibodies and oligonucleotide probes, respectively. Kainate treatment decreased EAAT3 immunoreactivity in stratum lacunosum moleculare within 4 h of seizure onset. Upon pyramidal cell death (5 days after kainate treatment), EAAT3 immunoreactivity in stratum pyramidale of CA1 and in stratum lacunosum moleculare was almost completely eliminated. The rapid effect of kainate on EAAT3 expression was confirmed by in situ hybridization; EAAT3 mRNA levels were decreased in CA1 and CA3 regions within 4-8 h of seizure onset. Kainate treatment had an opposite effect on levels and expression of EAAT2. Developmental studies indicated that the rapid regulation of transporter expression was not observed in rats younger than 21 days, an observation congruent with previous reports regarding the resistance of young rats to kainate. In hippocampal organotypic cultures, which lack a major excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex, kainate produced a slow decrease in [3H]d-aspartate uptake. This study indicates that an early effect of kainate treatment consists of down-regulation of the neuronal transporter EAAT3 in restricted hippocampal regions, together with a modest increase in the expression of the glial transporter EAAT2. Differential regulation of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters may thus play a role in kainate-induced seizure, neurotoxicity and neuronal plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Estrogen receptor mRNA alterations in the developing rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"We previously reported transiently elevated ER protein levels in the postnatal rat hippocampus suggesting that this brain region may be sensitive to estrogenic trophic and organizational influences during a 'critical period' of sexual differentiation. In order to examine whether alterations in ER gene expression underlie the ontogenetic pattern of the hippocampal ER, we examined ER mRNA levels over the early postnatal period and in adult rats. This was accomplished by both a highly quantitative RNase protection assay and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Hippocampal ER mRNA levels increased significantly (P < 0.005) between birth and postnatal day (PDN) 4 when peak concentrations were found and then declined by PND-10. Adult male hippocampal ER mRNA values were similar to those found in newborn and PND-10 animals but were significantly less (P < 0.05) than those observed on PND-4. Results from the in situ hybridization experiments correlated well with those from the RNase protection analysis. High levels of ER mRNA were present in the CA3 pyramidal layer with somewhat lower labeling intensities present in CA1 and the dentate gyrus of the PND-4 animal. In contrast, adult male animals demonstrated little hybridization throughout the hippocampus. Thus, the temporal pattern in ER mRNA levels in the hippocampus found in the present study correlates well with our previous developmental profile of the ER protein. These findings suggest that the ontogeny of ER in the hippocampus is regulated by alterations in ER gene expression in specific neuronal populations.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have investigated the distribution and morphology of hippocampal interneurons that express the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the rat. For this study, we combined in situ hybridization for the detection of NGF and NT-3 mRNAs and immunocytochemistry against the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PARV), calretinin (CALR), and calbindin (CALB). Whereas the majority of PARV+ interneurons expressed NGF mRNA, only subsets of CALR- and CALB-immunoreactive interneurons (23% and 24%, respectively) displayed NGF hybridization. Most CALB/NGF+ cells were located in the stratum oriens/alveus of the CA3-CA1 regions, suggesting that they may include the population of CALB+, hippocamposeptal, nonpyramidal neurons. Most of the nonspiny CALR/NGF+ neurons were located within or in the vicinity of the pyramidal layer and had faint CALR immunostaining and stellate, thin dendrites. Regarding the spiny CALR-immunoreactive cells, we found that most of these neurons in the hilus were NGF+, whereas only 59% of displayed NGF hybridization in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. A small subset of PARV- and CALR-immunoreactive cells expressed NT-3 mRNA (16% and 13%, respectively). NT-3 message was not found in the large basket cells of the dentate gyrus, whereas the distribution and morphology of CALR/NT-3+ cells were similar to those of nonspiny CALR/NGF+ cells. In fact, double in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that most NT-3+ neurons also expressed NGF mRNA, indicating coexpression of both neurotrophins in subpopulations of PARV+ and CALR+ neurons. Moreover, the level of NGF mRNA expression was higher in PARV+ neurons than in CALR- and CALB-immunoreactive interneurons, whereas NT-3 message was expressed similarly in PARV+ and CALR+ neurons. The present findings show a differential expression of NGF and NT-3 mRNAs in subsets of hippocampal interneurons and suggest that the expression of these transcripts depends on factors intrinsic to particular cell types.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Receptor autoradiography with the Y2 receptor ligand 125I-peptide YY3-36 and in situ hybridization were applied to investigate changes in neuropeptide tyrosine-Y2 receptor expression after kainic acid-induced recurrent seizures in the rat hippocampus. In the strata oriens and radiatum of CA1 to CA3, which are densely innervated by Y2 receptor-bearing Schaffer collateral terminals, a transient 2-fold increase in Y2 receptor affinity was observed after 4-12 hr, with a later slow decline. No change was seen in Y2 mRNA expression in CA2/CA3 pyramidal cells, from which Schaffer collaterals originate. Conversely, in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, markedly elevated Y2 mRNA concentrations were observed (by 740% in the dorsal hippocampus) 24-48 hr after kainate injection. At the same time, a marked and lasting (up to 6 months) increase in the number of Y2 receptor sites (by 800%) was seen in the dentate hilus, which is innervated densely by mossy fibers. The early increase in Y2 receptor affinity in Schaffer collaterals was accompanied by a 60% decrease in the EC50 of peptide YY3-36 in inhibiting K(+)-stimulated glutamate release in hippocampal slices from kainic acid-treated rats. Our data indicate transient up-regulation of presynaptic Y2 receptors in Schaffer collaterals by a change in affinity and a permanent de novo synthesis of presynaptic Y2 receptors in granule cells/mossy fibers. These changes may cause augmented presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release from different hippocampal sites and, in conjunction with increased concentrations of neuropeptide tyrosine in mossy fibers, may represent an endogenous reactive anticonvulsant mechanism.',\n",

Recent radioligand binding studies have identified high-affinity binding sites for 125I-recombinant human IL-1 alpha in the hippocampus with characteristics similar to those of IL-1 receptors in immune cells. The present study employed in situ hybridization histochemistry with 35S-labeled anti-sense cRNA probes derived from a full-length murine T-cell IL-1 receptor cDNA to identify cells producing IL-1 receptor mRNA in the murine hippocampus. An intense signal was observed over granule cells in the dentate gyrus. A weak to moderate signal was observed over the pyramidal cell layer of the hilus and CA3 region. Other aspects of the hippocampal formation, including the CA2 and CA1 regions, the subiculum, and the entorhinal area, displayed no signal above background. This distribution of IL-1 receptor mRNA was similar to that of 125I-IL-1 alpha binding sites and supports the growing body of evidence implicating IL-1 as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Clusterin is a protein that has been implicated in cell death and remodelling in a number of different tissues. To further investigate the role of clusterin in nerve cell death its expression was measured in the rat brain at various times after status epilepticus (SE) induced by 1 h of hippocampal stimulation, by using in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting. SE lead to a dramatic time-dependent increase in clusterin mRNA in non-nerve cells resembling astrocytes in the hippocampus beginning after 24 h. There was also an earlier induction of clusterin mRNA in dentate granule cells, that survive SE. Only a low mRNA signal was observed over the CA1 pyramidal cells, which die after SE. In contrast to these mRNA results, massive clusterin-like immunoreactivity was observed in CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate hilar neurons (and both of these neuronal populations die after SE), but not in dentate granule cells. We speculate that astrocytes produce clusterin after SE and that the clusterin is then secreted and taken up by hippocampal neurons destined to die. Thus, the role of clusterin in nerve cell death/ regeneration warrants further investigation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization was used to study the expression of members of the nerve growth factor family of trophic factors in rat hippocampus following stimulation of afferent cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways with quisqualate. A transient increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and beta-nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression in the hippocampus was seen 4 h after a quisqualate injection into the medial septal nucleus. Both BDNF and NGF mRNA levels increased more than 4-fold in the granule layer of the dentate gyrus and for BDNF mRNA also in the pyramidal cells of CA1, while the levels of BDNF mRNA in CA3 increased 2-fold. The increase in BDNF and NGF mRNA levels were completely prevented by pretreatment with systemic injections of either scopolamine or diazepam. A quisqualate injection into the entorhinal cortex, containing glutamatergic afferents to the hippocampus, resulted in a 15-, 5- and 17-fold increase in the expression of BDNF mRNA in the ipsilateral granule cells, CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells, respectively. Similar increases were also seen in the hippocampus contralateral to the injections. In contrast, the level of NGF mRNA did not increase significantly in any of the subfields in the hippocampus. The increase in BDNF mRNA after cortex injections was attenuated by diazepam but not by scopolamine. These findings imply that increased activity in afferent cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways to the hippocampus differentially regulate expression of the NGF family of neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Hippocampal CA1 neurons are the most vulnerable to transient cerebral ischemia. However, the mechanism has not been fully understood. The level of mRNA for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX-I), which is encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), progressively decreased in the hippocampal CA1 neurons of gerbils from 1 to 3 h of the reperfusion after 3.5 min of transient forebrain ischemia, and completely disappeared at 7 days. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) protein also showed the early decrease in the CA1 cells, and was followed by the reduction of the level of COX-I DNA after 2 days. However, the activity of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), a mitochondrial enzyme that is encoded by nuclear DNA, maintained normal activity until 1 day in the CA1 cells, and significantly decreased at 7 days. These results suggest that disturbance of mitochondrial DNA expression occurred in the CA1 neurons at the early stage of reperfusion, and was aggravated in the course of time. The disturbance could cause progressive failure of energy production of the cells that eventually results in the neuronal cell death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cellular localization of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression in the rat hippocampus was studied by in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled RNA-probes, complementary to either 513 bases of the rat brain mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mRNA or 500 bases of the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mRNA. Neurons in CA1, CA2, and the dentate gyrus expressed both receptor genes at high levels. The MR-mRNA was demonstrated in all pyramidal cell fields (CA1-4) of the hippocampal formation and the granular neurons of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, GR-mRNA was mainly restricted to CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cell fields and the dentate gyrus. This pattern of hybridization was found to agree with the cellular distribution of the two types of corticosteroid receptors detected previously in the hippocampus by autoradiography of the radio-labeled receptors and by immunocytochemistry of the receptor protein. These observations suggest that the corticosteroid receptors described previously as type 1 and type 2 are encoded by MR- and GR-mRNA, respectively. Although both the MR and GR genes are co-expressed in some hippocampal neurons, the unique patterns of distribution of the two receptor mRNAs in the hippocampal formation suggest that the genes for these receptors are differentially regulated. Moreover, the microanatomy of MR and GR expression provides insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the characteristic action of various steroids on behaviors involved in stress and circadian regulation.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Induction of caspase-3-like protease may mediate delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus after transient cerebral ischemia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Delayed neuronal death after transient cerebral ischemia may be mediated, in part, by the induction of apoptosis-regulatory gene products. Caspase-3 is a newly characterized mammalian cysteine protease that promotes cell death during brain development, in neuronal cultures, and in other cell types under many different conditions. To determine whether caspase-3 serves to regulate neuronal death after cerebral ischemia, we have (1) cloned a cDNA encoding the rat brain caspase-3; (2) examined caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression in the brain using in situ hybridization, Northern and Western blot analyses, and double-labeled immunohistochemistry; (3) determined caspase-3-like activity in brain cell extracts; and (4) studied the effect of caspase-3 inhibition on cell survival and DNA fragmentation in the hippocampus in a rat model of transient global ischemia. At 8-72 hr after ischemia, caspase-3 mRNA and protein were induced in the hippocampus and caudate-putamen (CPu), accompanied by increased caspase-3-like protease activity. In the hippocampus, caspase-3 mRNA and protein were predominantly increased in degenerating CA1 pyramidal neurons. Proteolytic activation of the caspase-3 precursor was detected in hippocampus and CPu but not in cortex at 4-72 hr after ischemia. Double-label experiments detected DNA fragmentation in the majority of CA1 neurons and selective CPu neurons that overexpressed caspase-3. Furthermore, ventricular infusion of Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, decreased caspase-3 activity in the hippocampus and significantly reduced cell death and DNA fragmentation in the CA1 sector up to 7 d after ischemia. These data strongly suggest that caspase-3 activity contributes to delayed neuronal death after transient ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Formation, differentiation, and plasticity of synapses require interactions between pre- and postsynaptic partners. Recently, it was shown that the transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily protein SYG-1 is required for providing synaptic specificity in C. elegans. However, it is unclear whether the mammalian orthologs of SYG-1 are also involved in local cell interactions to determine specificity during synapse formation. We used in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold electron microscopy to study the temporal and spatial expression of Neph1 and Neph2 in the developing and adult mouse brain. Both proteins show similar patterns with neuronal expression starting around embryonic days 12 and 11, respectively. Expression is strongest in areas of high migratory activity. In the adult brain, Neph1 and Neph2 are predominantly seen in the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in the hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. At the ultrastructural level, Neph1 and Neph2 are detectable within the dendritic shafts of pyramidal neurons. To a lesser extent, there is also synaptic localization of Neph1 within the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 region on both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Here it colocalizes with the synaptic scaffolder calmodulin-associated serin/threonin kinase (CASK), and both Neph1 and Neph2 interact with the PDZ domain of CASK via their cytoplasmic tail. Our results show that Neph proteins are expressed in the developing nervous system of mammals and suggest that these proteins may have a conserved function in synapse formation or neurogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have used in situ hybridization to determine the regional distribution of mRNA encoding the neurotensin/neuromedin N (NT/N) precursor in the forebrain of the adult male rat. Cells containing NT/N mRNA are widely distributed in the forebrain. These areas include the septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, hypothalamus, amygdala, accumbens nucleus, caudate-putamen, and piriform and retrosplenial cortex. In general, the regional distribution of NT/N mRNA corresponds to the previously determined distribution of neurotensin-immunoreactive cell bodies; however, several notable exceptions were observed. The most striking difference occurs specifically in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where intense labeling is associated with the pyramidal cell layer despite the reported absence of neurotensin-immunoreactive cells in this region. Analysis of microdissected tissue by S1 nuclease protection assay confirmed the abundance of authentic NT/N mRNA in CA1. A second major discrepancy between NT/N mRNA abundance and neurotensin-immunoreactivity occurs in the intensely labeled subiculum, a region that contains only scattered neurotensin-immunoreactive cells in the adult. These results suggest that, in specific regions of the forebrain, NT/N precursor is processed to yield products other than neurotensin. In addition, these results provide an anatomical basis for studying the physiological regulation of NT/N mRNA levels in the forebrain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'GTPases of the Rho subfamily, i.e. Rho, Rac and Cdc42, are molecular switches in various signaling pathways. Best characterized are their functions in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In neuronal cell lines they are involved in the mechanisms leading to synapse formation and plasticity. It is still unknown whether they have respective functions in the mammalian CNS. In this case, they should be present in the adult brain, especially in areas known for their synaptic remodeling. We have studied the expression of the Rho GTPases in adult rat brain with in situ hybridization and Western blot analysis. High amounts of RhoA, RhoB, Rac1 and Cdc42 mRNAs were detected in neurons of the hippocampus, i.e. in pyramidal cells of the CA1-CA4 regions as well as in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in hilar cells. Also in cerebellum, Purkinje and granular cells expressed the four mRNAs. Strong gene expression was also found in brainstem, thalamus and neocortex. Using Western blot analysis, RhoA and Cdc42 proteins were detected in hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus and neocortex.

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to study the distribution and possible co-expression of the messenger RNA of the somatostatin receptor subtypes SSTR-4 and SSTR-3 in rat brain. Our results demonstrate that SSTR-3 messenger RNA is widely expressed within the rat brain, while expression of SSTR-4 messenger RNA is restricted to the telencephalon, diencephalon and granular layer of the cerebellum. It is also shown that single neurons can co-express both SSTR-4 and SSTR-3 receptor messenger RNAs. The highest density of SSTR-4 messenger RNA was found in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, especially in the CA1 and CA2 areas, anterior olfactory nuclei, amygdala, and in layers IV and VI of the cerebral cortex. SSTR-3 messenger RNA displayed a homogeneous distribution in the cerebral cortex and was expressed in the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus, motor and sensory metencephalic nuclei, and the granular and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum. Whether SSTR-3 and SSTR-4 messenger RNA can be expressed by the same cell was assessed by the simultaneous use of digoxigenin (SSTR-3)- and isotopic (SSTR-4)-labelled oligoprobes. Co-expression of SSTR-3 and SSTR-4 messenger RNAs was found in neurons of the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus, in the subiculum and in layer IV of the cerebral cortex. The expression of two receptor subtypes of the same neurotransmitter in a single cell, if confirmed functionally, raises questions about the consequences of the simultaneous activation of these different receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'New developments in corticosteroid receptor research enabled us to perform a highly detailed study on the neuroanatomical topography of MR and GR in the rat hippocampus. Receptor immunocytochemistry was used to map the distribution of GR protein with the help of a monoclonal antibody raised against the purified rat liver GR-hormone complex. Furthermore, in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled RNA probes, which were transcribed from cDNAs complementary to either a fragment of the rat brain MR gene or to the rat liver GR gene, was applied to investigate the localization of MR and GR mRNA in the limbic brain. The pyramidal neurons of cell field Ca1 and CA2 and the granular neurons of the dentate gyrus showed marked GR immunoreactivity (GRir) as well as intense labeling of GR mRNA. The radiolabeled density of GR mRNA in cell fields CA3 and CA4 was considerable less, whereas low-to-almost-undetectable levels of GRir could be observed in these regions. MR mRNA appeared to be evenly distributed over all cell fields of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus. The topography of GRir, GR mRNA and MR mRNA was found to agree with the cellular distribution of MR and GR binding sites in the hippocampus. Moreover, the microanatomy of MR and GR in the hippocampus appeared to overlap. Our data strongly suggest that MR and GR are co-expressed in the majority of pyramidal and granular neurons of the hippocampal formation. This assumption is based on coherence in the detection of different aspects of the receptor cycle of MR and GR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A cDNA encoding a novel voltage-gated K(+) channel protein was isolated from human brain. This protein, termed BEC1, is 46% identical to rat elk in the ether-à-go-go K(+) channel family. The BEC1 gene maps to the 12q13 region of the human genome. Northern blot analysis indicates that BEC1 is exclusively expressed in human brain, where the expression is concentrated in the telencephalic areas such as the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and striatum. By in situ hybridization, BEC1 is detected in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layers and the dentate gyrus granule cell layers of the hippocampus. Specific signals are also found in neocortical neurons. Transfection of mammalian L929 and Chinese hamster ovary cells with BEC1 cDNA induces a voltage-gated outward current with a fast inactivation component. This current is insensitive to tetraethylammonium and quinidine. Additionally, a second related gene BEC2 was isolated from human brain. BEC2 is also brain-specific, located in the neocortex and the striatum, and functional as a channel gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that BEC1 and BEC2 constitute a subfamily, together with elk, in the ether-à-go-go family. The two genes may be involved in cellular excitability of restricted neurons in the human central nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Histochemical localization of superoxide anion (O2.-) scavenging activity in rat brain was visualized by the tissue-blotting technique. The activity was thought to mainly depend on Cu/Zn-SOD, because the localization of the activity was identical with the immunohistochemistry of Cu/Zn-SOD and the localization of its mRNA in the brain. Moreover, the activity was dramatically decreased after treatment of Cu (I) chelater. The activity was detected in pyramidal cells of the cortex, granular, and mitral cells of the olfactory bulbs, pyramidal cell layer CA1 to CA3, and dentate gyrus of hippocampus formation and granular cells of the cerebellum. Moreover, the activity was detected in the pontine nuclei of brain stem. Olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, and cerebellum were believed to be bestowed high brain functions, i.e., long-term potentiation and long-term depression. A part of the function was regulated by a retrograde neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (.NO). Our findings suggest that the SOD is colocalized with NO synthase in olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, and cerebellum, where .NO plays the important roles. In contrast, low SOD activity was observed in the axonal neurofiber bundles, although the regions contain a lot of membrane lipids, which was thought to be peroxidized by O2.- and related radicals such as .OH in the regions. From these findings, it was suggested that the SOD did not only play a role in protecting the neurons from endogenously formed O2.-, but also play a role in preservation of beneficial natures of .NO in the brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The serotonin 5-HT3 receptor subtype has been implicated in many brain functions. Antagonists of this receptor have anxiolytic and antiemetic effects in humans and in animal models. To determine with cellular resolution the distribution of 5-HT3 receptor mRNA, in situ hybridization was performed in sections of mouse brain and dorsal root ganglia. Scattered labeled cells were observed throughout cortical regions, with highest densities in the piriform, cingulate, and entorhinal areas. Strong hybridization signals were seen in the hippocampal formation, where expression appeared primarily in interneurons. Labeled cells were most abundant in the posteroventral hippocampal region, particularly in the lacunosum moleculare layer of CA1. This distribution suggests that 5-HT3 receptors may mediate the known serotonergic inhibition of pyramidal cell populations via excitation of inhibitory interneurons. Labeled cells were also observed in the major subdivisions of the amygdaloid complex, the olfactory bulb, the trochlear nerve nucleus, the dorsal tegmental region, the facial nerve nucleus, the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, and the spinal cord dorsal horn. In the periphery, intense hybridization signals were seen in a subpopulation of cells in dorsal root ganglia. The data correlate generally with physiological, behavioral, and receptor autoradiographic studies, provide cellular resolution, and reveal regions of receptor expression not previously observed. The distribution of 5-HT3 receptor mRNA is consistent with roles for the receptor in cognition and affect and in the modulation of sensory input.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The present study demonstrates that chronic, but not acute, adminstration of several different classes of antidepressants, including serotonin- and norepinephrine-selective reuptake inhibitors, increases the expression of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) mRNA in rat hippocampus. In contrast, chronic administration of several nonantidepressant psychotropic drugs did not influence expression of CREB mRNA, demonstrating the pharmacological specificity of this effect. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrates that antidepressant administration increases expression of CREB mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cell layers of the hippocampus. In addition, levels of CRE immunoreactivity and of CRE binding activity were increased by chronic antidepressant administration, which indicates that expression and function of CREB protein are increased along with its mRNA. Chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors rolipram or papaverine also increased expression of CREB mRNA in hippocampus, demonstrating a role for the cAMP cascade. Moreover, coadministration of rolipram with imipramine resulted in a more rapid induction of CREB than with either treatment alone. Increased expression and function of CREB suggest that specific target genes may be regulated by these treatments. We have found that levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and trkB mRNA are also increased by administration of antidepressants or PDE inhibitors. These findings indicate that upregulation of CREB is a common action of chronic antidepressant treatments that may lead to regulation of specific target genes, such as BDNF and trkB, and to the long-term effects of these treatments on brain function.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Receptors for vitamin D hormone (VDR) and the calcium binding protein, calbindin-28k, have been localized in many tissues, including brain. In brain, VDR and calbindin-28k were reported to colocalize in hippocampal CA1 cells. We have shown that mRNA pool size for calbindin-28k was reduced, on average, by 35% in Alzheimer hippocampal CA1 cells, as compared to Huntington control (manuscript in preparation). In the present study, in situ hybridization with tritiated antisense RNA probes was used to examine VDR expression in paired Alzheimer and Huntington brain tissue. Message levels for VDR were reduced, on average, by 34% and 31%, respectively, in Alzheimer hippocampal CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cells, as compared to Huntington control. However, VDR message levels were not significantly different from control in Alzheimer temporal cortex or cerebellum. There was no correlation between VDR message levels and brain weight, autopsy interval, patient age or the extent of neurofibrillary degeneration. Instead, VDR mRNA pool size in hippocampal CA1 cells correlated significantly with calbindin-28k message levels (r = 0.52, P less than 0.001). Decreased message levels for VDR and calbindin-28k in these cells were due to an increased percentage of cells expressing lower message levels for these proteins. These results show that in Alzheimer hippocampal CA1 cells, VDR mRNA pool size is downregulated and that this downregulation may play a role in the reduction of calbindin-28k expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Corticosteroids have been implicated in hippocampal atrophy in patients with severe psychiatric disorders, but little is known about receptor expression for corticosteroids in human or nonhuman primate brain. Both the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) were surveyed in this study of squirrel monkey brain using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Regions of high GR mRNA levels included CA1 and CA2 of hippocampus, dentate gyrus, paraventricular hypothalamus, lateral geniculate, lateral>medial amygdala, and cerebellum. Western analysis confirmed that GR immunoreactivity in squirrel monkey brain tissue most likely reflects the alpha isoform. Regions of high MR mRNA levels included all hippocampal pyramidal cell fields, dentate gyrus granule cell layer, lateral septum, medial>lateral amygdala, and to a lesser extent, cerebellum. Low levels of MR were also expressed in caudate and putamen. Receptor expression for corticosteroids in deep brain structures and the hippocampal formation was similar to that previously reported in rodents, but GR and MR mRNA were expressed at higher levels in squirrel monkey cerebral cortex. GR expression was evident in all cortical layers, particularly the pyramidal cell-rich layers II/III and V. MR expression was restricted to the more superficial cortical layers, and was only moderately represented in layer V. Laminar patterns were apparent in all regions of cortex for GR expression in squirrel monkeys, but low MR mRNA levels were found in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC). Different subregional distributions and distinctive laminar patterns suggest specialized functions or coordinated interactions between GR and MR mediated functions in primate PFC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2C) is a transcription factor expressed at high levels in brain. In this study, the distribution of MEF2C expression in brain was studied in normal adult gerbils and in adult gerbils subjected to 10 min of global cerebral ischemia. In normal animals, MEF2C-immunoreactivity and messenger RNA expression were detected in cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. Within the hippocampus, MEF2C-immunoreactivity and MEF2C messenger RNA were found in interneurons scattered through the CA fields, a subset of which are parvalbumin-immunoreactive. MEF2C-immunoreactivity and MEF2C messenger RNA were also present in granule cells in the dentate gyrus. MEF2C-immunoreactivity was also detected in microglia in the hippocampus. After transient forebrain ischemia, CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are MEF2C-negative, degenerate whereas MEF2C-positive interneurons survive. Our results thus indicate that MEF2C is a marker for hippocampal neurons that are resistant to ischemia. It remains to be determined whether MEF2C plays a direct role in protecting the neurons that express it from ischemic injury. In addition, MEF2C-immunoreactivity is present in microglia, and, after ischemia, there were increased numbers of MEF2C-immunoreactive microglia in CA1, so MEF2C-immunoreactivity is a marker of both resting and activated microglia.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity is associated with a complex c-Fos and c-Jun response which does not preclude either cell death or survival.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'c-fos and c-jun mRNA induction and c-Fos and c-Jun protein expression were examined in the brains of adult rats subjected to systemic kainic acid (KA) injection at convulsant doses. Induction of c-fos and c-jun mRNA, as seen with in situ hybridization, occurred in the piriform and entorhinal cortices, neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and discrete thalamic nuclei. This was followed by c-Fos protein expression, as revealed with immunohistochemistry, in the same regions. However, the distribution of c-Jun protein expression differed depending on the antibody used. The distribution of cells immunostained with the antibody c-Jun (AB-1) was similar to that of c-jun mRNA, but the distribution of cells immunostained with the antibody c-Jun/AP1 (N) was restricted to a few neurons in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 and CA3, layer II of the piriform and entorhinal cortices, basal amygdala, and discrete thalamic nuclei. Although the regional distribution of c-Fos- and c-Jun-immunoreactive cells in the hippocampus, layer II of the entorhinal and piriform cortices, basal amygdala, and discrete thalamic nuclei matched the distribution of cells committed to dying, c-Fos- and c-Jun-immunoreactive cells in the neocortex and dentate gyrus survived. Therefore, the present data show that c-fos and c-jun are not predictors of either cell death or survival, but rather, markers of cells sensitive to KA excitotoxicity. Western blots to c-Fos showed a double band at p62 in samples containing the hippocampus and entorhinal and piriform cortices (hip samples) and in samples containing the neocortex (cortex samples). The upper band was abolished following preincubation of the samples with alkaline phosphatase, thus suggesting c-Fos phosphorylation. Western blots to c-Jun (AB-1) showed a single band at about p39 in hip and cortex. However, Western blots to c-Jun/AP1 (N) identified two bands. One band at about p39 was seen in control rats and the cortex of KA-treated rats. Another band at p26 was observed only in hip samples of KA-treated rats. In addition, decreased c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) expression, as revealed on Western blots, was coincidental with the appearance of the p26 c-Jun-immunoreactive band in KA-treated rats. These results show that c-Fos and different Jun-related antigens are expressed following KA excitotoxicity, and that posttranslational modifications involving phosphorylation of c-Fos and Jun(s) may occur following KA injection. These results also stress the necessity of examining the composition of Fos and Jun-related antigens and the metabolic state of Fos and Jun(s) in different experimental models of nervous system injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Housing rats in an enriched environment after focal brain ischemia improves functional outcome without changes in infarct volume, suggesting neuroplastic changes outside the lesion. In this study, permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was followed by housing in an enriched or a standard environment. Nerve growth factor-induced gene A and glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression were determined by in situ hybridization two to 30 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Stroke induced a decrease in nerve growth factor-induced gene A messenger RNA expression in cortical areas outside the ischemic lesion and in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus two to three days after ischemia. This decrease was more prolonged with environmental enrichment, lasting until 20 days. However, 30 days after focal cerebral ischemia, environmental enrichment increased nerve growth factor-induced gene A expression compared to standard housing. A reduction of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (type II) messenger RNA two to 12 days after stroke in standard housed rats was restored by environmental enrichment. These data suggest that improved functional outcome induced by environmental enrichment after middle cerebral artery occlusion is associated with dynamically altered expression of nerve growth factor-induced gene A messenger RNA in brain regions outside the ischemic lesion, and sustained levels of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression.',\n",

About 80% or more of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal subregions expressed mRNAs for individual receptors in the brains of subjects younger than 65. The ratio of mRNA-containing neuron density to total neuron density significantly decreased with age for GR in CA1 and CA3, and for AR in CA1. Non-significant trends in the reduction with age in the ratio of ER mRNA-containing neurons in CA1 and the ratio of GR mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus also were found.

       "  'Abstract': 'Several prohormone convertases that are involved in the posttranslational processing of precursor proteins, including neuropetides, hormones and neurotrophic factors, are produced in the central nervous system. These include enzymes named furin, PC1, PC2, PC5 and PACE4. To understand better the potential role played by prohormone convertases in the central nervous system we studied the expression of their messenger RNAs in the hippocampus of rats with pilocarpine-induced seizures. Moreover, we compared their expression patterns with those of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which are up-regulated in the hippocampus during seizures. Pilocarpine (380 mg/kg, i.p.) induced seizure activity that appeared within the first hour and persisted for approximately 8 h. In situ hybridization showed transient increases in messenger RNA for nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor that peaked at 120 min in the hippocampus. Among the convertases studied, only PC1 messenger RNA displayed up-regulation, with temporal and topographic features comparable to those of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA. The expression of furin, PC2 and PC5 messenger RNA changed little, while PACE4 was not expressed at all, both before and after pilocarpine administration. The highest increase in PC1 messenger RNA expression was found in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and, to a lesser extent, in the pyramidal layer of CA1 and CA3 subfields. Thus, in the rat hippocampus, the epileptiform activity induced by pilocarpine mediates a co-ordinated expression of messenger RNAs for PC1, nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our findings suggest the involvement of PC1 in the processing of precursor proteins during seizure activity.',\n",

Transient decreases of Y1-R mRNA levels were detected at 2-4 h in hippocampal subregions, amygdala, piriform, entorhinal and somatosensory cortices. The Y2-R mRNA levels were reduced at 2-4 h in the CA3 region and piriform cortex, but exhibited marked increases at 48 h and 1 week post-seizure in the dentate gyrus, amygdala and piriform and entorhinal cortices. At 3 weeks, Y2-R mRNA expression had virtually returned to baseline. Elevated Y5-R mRNA levels were only detected at 2-4 h and confined to dentate granule cell layer and piriform and entorhinal cortices. These results demonstrate a cell- and region-specific, differential regulation of mRNA expression for NPY and Y1-R, Y2-R, and Y5-R in the limbic system following recurring seizures. Because the gene changes were transient, it seems unlikely that the presumed alterations of the corresponding proteins are involved in the maintenance of the epileptic syndrome, which develops up to 4 weeks post-seizure in the present model and is stable thereafter. Our data provide further support for the hypothesis that the changes of NPY and its receptors act to dampen seizure susceptibility, and suggest that the cascade of gene changes is orchestrated to optimize this anticonvulsant effect.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have examined the role apoptosis plays in epileptic brain damage using intra-amygdaloid injection of kainate. With the silver staining technique of Gallyas, argyrophylic (dying) neurons were observed, a few hours after the injection, in the amygdala and in the vulnerable pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA3 region. In both areas, cell death has apoptotic features, including: (i) nuclear chromatin condensation and marginalization with light and electron microscopy; (ii) DNA fragmentation with a typical ladder pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis; (iii) positive nuclear labelling with a selective in situ DNA fragmentation staining method. Combined in situ DNA labelling and silver staining showed that the DNA fragmentation occurred in dying neurons. CA1 or granule cells which do not degenerate following intra-amygdaloid injection of kainate were not stained with the in situ DNA labelling or the argyrophylic technique. Administration of diazepam blocked the kainate-induced seizures and prevented DNA fragmentation in CA3 but not in the amygdala. Therefore, apoptosis contributes to the local and distant damage induced by kainate.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) was explored in mechanisms underlying the action of amphetamine (AMPH). The activity of mGluR5 was monitored by measuring the level of [3H]inositol monophosphates in brain neurons, in response to stimulation of 2-choloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), a selective agonist of mGluR5. Treatment with 1 microM of AMPH for 1 h or 7 days increased the CHPG (1 mM, 30 min)-evoked phosphoinositide turnover by 46% or 92% and 26% or 84% in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons, respectively, from that of CHPG-only treated cells. When AMPH was present during CHPG application post-1 h or 7 day AMPH incubation, the rate of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cortical neurons became 121% or 142% higher than that treated with CHPG only. The postnatal day (P) 21 (juvenile) and P60 (adult) rats received three intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg/kg of AMPH or saline daily for 6 days. They were challenged on the eighth day with one dosage and sacrificed 3 h later. Reversible 3H-glutamate binding detected increases of 22-89% in the binding levels of cortex and hippocampus of both ages following the AMPH injections. Increases of 13-18% in the levels of mGluR5 mRNA were seen in the juvenile pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1-4, granular cells of dentate gyrus, and ventral thalamic nuclei, as shown by in situ hybridization. The AMPH-induced altered activity of mGluR5 is probably associated with changes in the expression of the glutamate receptors, including mGluR5. AMPH may modify the sensitivity of mGluR5 or interact with the receptor itself.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To investigate the role of calcineurin (CaN) in the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders, we examined the expression of CaN A mRNA and the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of CaN in the rat brain following various restraint stress paradigms. Northern blot analysis revealed no significant changes in the levels of CaN A mRNA expression, in either the frontal cortex or the hippocampus, in response to a single restraint stress for either 15, 45, or 90 min. In addition, no significant change in the levels of CaN A mRNA was found 3 or 6 h after a single restraint stress for 90 min. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that a single restraint stress for 45 min had no influence on CaN A mRNA expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers or in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of the hippocampus. However, serine/threonine phosphatase activity was significantly increased in both regions in response to a single restraint stress for either 45 or 90 min. These results demonstrate that the single restraint stress paradigms used in this study increase the activity of CaN without any changes in the expression of CaN, suggesting that the activation of calmodulin and the increased levels of heat shock proteins in response to the restraint stress may upregulate the activity of CaN in the rat brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor rho subunits recently cloned from rat and human retina are thought to form GABA receptor channels belonging to a pharmacologically distinct receptor class, termed GABA(C). In this work we have examined the distribution of rho1, rho2 and rho3 subunits, and found expression of all three transcripts in several regions of the rat nervous system. In situ hybridization revealed expression of rho2 in the adult rat retina and some other parts of the visual pathways. A high local rho2 expression was seen in the superficial grey layer of the superior colliculus, and in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Expression was also detected in the 6th layer of visual cortex and in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of hippocampus. With reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, expression of rho1 was mainly seen in the adult rat retina and dorsal root ganglia, as well as, at a significantly lower level, in the superior colliculus, hippocampus, brain stem, thalamus, postnatal day 8 (P8) superior colliculus and P8 hippocampus. Expression pattern of rho3 mRNA was clearly different from that of rho1 and rho2, being strongest in the hippocampus, and significantly lower in the retina, dorsal root ganglia and cortex. No rho3 expression was observed in adult or P8 superior colliculus or in P8 hippocampus. The present results clearly demonstrate that expression of GABA receptor rho subunits is not restricted to the retina, but significant expression can also be detected in many other brain regions, especially in those belonging to the visual pathways. The expression pattern of the rho subunits may be helpful in solving the functional significance of the receptors formed from these subunits.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The influence of sustained epileptic seizures evoked by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid on the gene expression of the neuropeptides somatostatin and neuropeptide Y and on the damage of neurons containing these peptides was studied in the rat brain. Injection of kainic acid induced an extensive loss of somatostatin and, though less pronounced, of neuropeptide Y neurons in the inner part of the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive neurons located in the subgranular layer of the hilus, presumably pyramidal-shaped basket cells, were spared by the treatment. Although neuropeptide Y messenger RNA was not detected in granule cells of control rats, it was found there after kainic acid seizures at all time intervals investigated (12 h to 90 days after injection of kainic acid). High concentrations of neuropeptide Y messenger RNA were especially observed 24 h after injection of kainic acid. At this time neuropeptide Y messenger RNA was also transiently observed in CA1 pyramidal cells. Neuropeptide Y synthesis in granule cells in turn gave rise to an intense immunoreactivity of the peptide in the terminal field of mossy fibers which persisted for the entire time period (90 days) investigated. In addition, neuropeptide Y messenger RNA concentrations were also drastically elevated in presumptive basket cells located at the inner surface of the granule cell layer, especially at the \"late\" time intervals investigated (30-90 days after kainic acid). These data support the concept that extensive activation of granule cells by limbic seizures contributes to the observed neuronal cell death in CA3 pyramidal neurons and interneurons of the hilus. Consecutively, basket cells containing neuropeptide Y and presumably GABA might be activated and participate in recurrent inhibition of granule cells. Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive fibers observed in the inner molecular layer at \"late\" time intervals after kainic acid may result either from collateral sprouting of mossy fibers or from basket cells extensively expressing the peptide. It is speculated that neuropeptide Y synthesized and released at a high rate from granule cells and basket cells may exert a protective action against seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We investigated the temporal and spatial profile of mRNA transcription for the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene GADD45, DNA fragmentation, and neuronal death in rat brain following focally evoked limbic seizures. GADD45 mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization, whereas fragmented DNA was detected using in situ nick end-labeling by the large (Klenow) fragment of DNA polymerase I. Kainic acid (0.1 microg) was injected into the right amygdala of rats to induce seizures for 45 min, after which diazepam (30 mg/kg) was administered. GADD45 mRNA, DNA fragmentation, and cell death were quantified bilaterally within six limbic brain regions 0-96 h following seizure cessation. All animals underwent seizures of equivalent severity and duration as determined electrographically. In situ hybridization detected bilateral up-regulation of GADD45 mRNA throughout the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the piriform and retrosplenial cortices, and the thalamus within 1 h of seizure termination. GADD45 mRNA levels remained elevated for up to 6 h, declining to baseline within all structures by 16 h. Klenow-positive cells were only found within the CA3 pyramidal layer of the ipsilateral hippocampus and appeared 16-72 h following seizure cessation. Morphologic cell death was also restricted to the CA3 subfield. These data demonstrate that focally evoked limbic seizures trigger early bihemispheric GADD45 mRNA transcription within connected limbic structures, whereas subsequent DNA fragmentation and cell death are restricted to selectively vulnerable brain regions.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Learning-induced alterations in hippocampal PKC-immunoreactivity: a review and hypothesis of its functional significance.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': '1. To localize protein kinase C (PKC) in the hippocampus, PKC activity measures, mRNA in situ hybridization, and [3H]phorbol ester binding techniques were used until in the 1980s antibodies became available for in situ immunocytochemistry. In the late 1980s, PKC-isoform-specific antibodies were first used to map hippocampal PKC at the cellular and subcellular level. The mammalian hippocampus contains all four Ca(2+)-dependent PKC isoforms, but the (sub)cellular localization is both isoform- and species-specific. 2. Hippocampally-dependent spatial and associative learning in rat, mice and rabbit induce an increase in PKC immunoreactivity (ir) in hippocampal principal cells studied 24 hours after the animals had learned the task. Among the four Ca(2+)-dependent PKC subtypes, this increase is selective for the gamma-isoform. The presence of the gamma-isoform in dendritic spines (the most likely site for synaptic plasticity and information storage), in contrast to PKC alpha, beta 1, and beta 2, may underlie the isoform-selectivity. 3. Compared to fully trained animals, subjects halfway training showed intermediate levels of increased PKC gamma-ir. Poor learners that were not able to learn the task showed considerably less enhanced PKC gamma-ir as compared to good learners. 4. Associative learning induced a decrease in astroglial PKC beta 2 and gamma-ir in those regions where a simultaneous increase in neuronal PKC gamma-ir was observed. This decrease most likely reflects PKC down-regulation, enabling the astrocytes to maintain their K+ buffering capacity necessary to support neuronal activity such as accompanying learning and memory. 5. Western blot analyses revealed that the increase in PKC gamma-ir was not due to an increase in total amount of PKC gamma, translocation, or the proteolytic generation of the fragment PKM. The increase in PKC gamma-ir must therefore reflect a learning-induced conformational change in the PKC gamma molecule that results in the exposure of the antigenic site(s). 6. Although a large number of hippocampal pyramidal cells display learning-induced enhancement of PKC gamma-ir at the 24 hours post-training time point, this does not indicate, however, that all synapses in these neurons are used, or that the maximal PKC signal transduction capacity per call has been reached. 7. The enhanced PKC gamma-ir may reflect a form of activated PKC, since PKC stimulation by phorbol esters (both in hippocampal slices and mildly aldehyde fixed sections) mimicked the increase in PKC gamma-ir similar as seen after learning. 8. The most likely transmitter systems which may have induced the altered PKC gamma-ir are acetylcholine and glutamate. Their contribution and interaction at the cellular level are depicted in a schematic circuit terminating on a CA1 pyramidal cell (Fig. 4). 9. Several functional roles for PKC gamma in learning and memory are discussed, and a hypothetical model is proposed based on an endogeneous PKC inhibitor protein that may explain altered antibody-binding to PKC gamma after learning (Fig. 6). 10. The immunocytochemical approach can contribute significantly to the ongoing attempts to decipher part of the cellular and biochemical mechanism of learning and memory. The development of ever more specific and better characterized antibodies reactive with different sites of proteins like PKC gamma will offer the necessary tools for further immunocytochemical research to help unravel complex brain functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using in situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry, mRNA and protein expression of the novel DNA damage-inducible gene GADD45 was examined in the rat brain at 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 hours after 15 minutes of transient global ischemia. Transient ischemia produced by the four-vessel occlusion method resulted in DNA double-strand breaks and delayed neuronal cell death in vulnerable neurons of the hippocampal CA1 sector, the hilus, dorsal caudate-putamen, and thalamus, as shown by in situ DNA nick end-labeling and histologic staining. GADD45 mRNA was transiently increased in less-vulnerable regions such as the parietal cortex (up to 8 hours after ischemia) and dentate granule cells (up to 24 hours after ischemia) but was persistently increased in vulnerable neurons such as CA1 pyramidal neurons (up to 48 hours). GADD45 immunoreactivity was increased in both vulnerable and less-vulnerable regions at earlier reperfusion periods (4 to 16 hours), but thereafter immunoreactivity was decreased below control levels in most vulnerable regions before delayed cell death and DNA double-strand breaks. At 72 hours after transient ischemia, a moderate increase in GADD45 immunoreactivity was still detectable in some CA3 neurons and in a few surviving neurons in the CA1 region. Double staining performed at 16 to 72 hours after ischemia revealed that GADD45 immunoreactivity was persistently increased in neurons that did not develop DNA damage. Because GADD45 protein may participate in the DNA excision repair process and because it has been shown that this protein is also overexpressed in neurons that survive focal ischemia and kainate-induced epileptic seizures, the results reported here support the hypothesis that GADD45 could have a protective role in neuronal injury.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of hippocalcin in the developing rat brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Expression of hippocalcin in the developing rat brain was investigated by a combination of Northern blot, in situ hybridization, immunoblot and immunohistochemical methods. In the hippocampus, hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity first appeared in the CA3 pyramidal cells on embryonic day 19 (E19) and postnatal day 1 (P1), respectively, and extended throughout Ammon's horn. After P14, the hippocampal pyramidal cells, especially in the CA1 region, maintained the highest expression level among the brain regions. The dentate granule cells expressed a small amount of hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity from P7 and maintained a low level through the developmental stages. In the cerebral cortex, hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity appeared in the pyramidal cells of the piriform cortex from P1 and P4, respectively. Their expression extended throughout the cerebral cortex and reached the maximum level on P14, and then declined gradually with age to half of the maximum level by adults. In the cerebellum, a few Purkinje cells expressed a small amount of hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity on P7. Their expression became evident in most of the Purkinje cells on P14 and increased gradually by P28. Then, their expression declined with age; however, the immunoreactivity was concentrated in the cell bodies and proximal segments of the dendrites in adults. These results suggest that the expression of hippocalcin mRNA and protein is strictly controlled by both the cell type and the developmental process and that hippocalcin plays a role in neuronal differentiation in the early stages of development and may relate to other neuronal function in the adult brain.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Stress induced changes in cortical and hypothalamic c-fos expression are altered in fragile X mutant mice.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Fragile X (FraX) syndrome is characterized by mental retardation and a behavioral phenotype that includes stress-related behaviors. Recently, FraX children were shown to have elevated glucocorticoid hormones under basal conditions and an exaggerated hormonal response to stress. In the present study, fragile X mental retardation 1-knockout (Fmr1-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to immobilization stress for 30 min or 2 h, killed with paired controls, and the hippocampus, neocortex, and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) assessed by in situ hybridization for effects on c-fos mRNA. The main effect of stress in hippocampus was a reduction in mRNA levels within CA3-CA1 pyramidal cells in both genotypes. Stress significantly reduced CA1 c-fos mRNA in Fmr1-KOs at 30 min (-41%) and 2 h (-57%), whereas in WTs levels were significantly reduced only at 2 h (-57%). In neocortex, 30 min stress significantly increased c-fos mRNA in Fmr1-KOs only (+53%); however, by 2 h levels were reduced in both genotypes versus respective controls. In the paraventricular nucleus, c-fos mRNA levels were significantly, and equally, increased in both genotypes at 30 min. However, at 2 h, mRNA levels were still elevated in the Fmr1-KOs, whereas they had returned to control values in the WTs. Finally, immobilization stress significantly increased serum corticosterone levels in both genotypes at 30 min and 2 h, with Fmr1-KOs exhibiting greater levels than WTs; levels were statistically different at 2 h. These data indicate a greater response to stress in FraX mutants than in WTs, and further support the hypothesis of a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in FraX syndrome.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution and hormonal regulation of androgen receptor (AR) and AR messenger ribonucleic acid in the rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The actions of androgens in both peripheral and central tissues are linked in part to their ability to specifically bind and activate androgen receptors (ARs). ARs have been well studied in the rat hypothalamus and peripheral reproductive tissues, where they are directly involved in endocrine feedback mechanisms and reproduction. Previous studies revealed relatively high levels of AR and AR messenger RNA (mRNA) in the rat hippocampus; however, the action of androgen in this brain region remains unclear. To begin to address this issue, we used a multidisciplinary approach to quantitate hippocampal AR and AR mRNA levels and investigate their regulation after various hormonal manipulations. In vitro binding assays revealed a single, saturable, high affinity binding site for androgen in hippocampal cytosols. The expression of AR mRNA in the intact adult male rat hypothalamus and hippocampus was demonstrated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and quantified using a ribonuclease protection assay. Comparable levels of AR mRNA were found in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. In addition, in situ hybridization analysis revealed a unique distribution of AR mRNA in the hippocampus. AR mRNA was found predominately in the CA1 pyramidal cells, which form the major signal output of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from microdissected hippocampal regions confirmed this distribution. Ribonuclease protection assay demonstrated a significant decrease in the AR mRNA content of the hippocampus in animals killed 4 days after castration or in intact rats after four daily injections of the AR antagonist, flutamide (15 mg/animal), compared to that in intact controls (P < 0.01). In contrast, a 35% increase (P < 0.05) in the hippocampal AR mRNA content was found in old (22-month-old) compared to young (5-month-old) male rats. In both cases, [3H]dihydrotestosterone binding to the cytosolic preparation did not parallel the changes observed in the AR mRNA content. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hippocampal cells containing AR can respond to circulating androgen to alter AR gene expression. Furthermore, AR mRNA autoregulation appears to be both age and tissue specific and does not directly follow the regulatory patterns described for other steroid hormone receptors found in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mammalian Kv4 gene subfamily and its Drosophila Shal counterpart encode proteins that form fast inactivating K+ channels that activate and inactivate at subthreshold potentials and recover from inactivation at a faster rate than other inactivating Kv channels. Taken together, the properties of Kv4 channels compare best with those of low-voltage activating \"A-currents\" present in the neuronal somatodendritic compartment and widely reported across several types of central and peripheral neurons, as well as the (Ca2+-independent) transient outward potassium conductance of heart cells (Ito). Three distinct genes have been identified that encode mammalian Shal homologs (Kv4. 1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3), of which the latter two are abundant in rat adult brain and heart tissues. The distribution in the adult rat brain of the mRNA transcripts encoding the three known Kv4 subunits was studied by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Kv4.1 signals are very faint, suggesting that Kv4.1 mRNAs are expressed at very low levels, but Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 transcripts appear to be abundant and each produces a unique pattern of expression. Although there is overlap expression of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 transcripts in several neuronal populations, the dominant feature is one of differential, and sometimes reciprocal expression. For example, Kv4.2 transcripts are the predominant form in the caudate-putamen, pontine nucleus and several nuclei in the medula, whereas the substantia nigra pars compacta, the restrosplenial cortex, the superior colliculus, the raphe, and the amygdala express mainly Kv4.3. Some brain structures contain both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 mRNAs but each dominates in distinct neuronal subpopulations. For example, in the olfactory bulb Kv4.2 dominates in granule cells and Kv4.3 in periglomerular cells. In the hippocampus Kv4.2 is the most abundant isoform in CA1 pyramidal cells, whereas only Kv4.3 is expressed in interneurons. Both are abundant in CA2-CA3 pyramidal cells and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, which also express Kv4.1. In the dorsal thalamus strong Kv4.3 signals are seen in several lateral nuclei, whereas medial nuclei express Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 at moderate to low levels. In the cerebellum Kv4.3, but not Kv4.2, is expressed in Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons. In the cerebellar granule cell layer, the reciprocity between Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 is observed in subregions of the same neuronal population. In fact, the distribution of Kv4 channel transcripts in the cerebellum defines a new pattern of compartmentation of the cerebellar cortex and the first one involving molecules directly involved in signal processing.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has shown to play an important role in the cognitive deficits associated with developmental lead (Pb) exposure. In this study, we examined the effects of low-level Pb exposure on NMDA receptor subunit gene expression in the developing rat brain. The pattern of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C subunit mRNA in situ hybridization was consistent with previous studies. Brain levels of NR1 and NR2A mRNAs were lowest shortly after birth, increasing to reach peak levels by 14 or 21 days of age and subsequently decreasing at 28 days of age. NR2B mRNA levels were highest during early development and decreased as the animals aged. NR2C subunit mRNA was restricted to the cerebellum and a signal was not detectable until the second week of life. Lead exposure resulted in significant and opposite effects in NR1 and NR2A subunit mRNA expression with no changes in NR2B or NR2C subunit expression. The Pb-induced changes in NR1 and NR2A subunit mRNA were mainly present in the hippocampus. Hippocampal NR1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the CA1 (15.3%) and CA4 (26.8%) pyramidal cells from 14-day-old Pb-exposed rats. At 21 days of age, only the NR1 mRNA at the CA4 subfield remained significantly elevated (10.3%). Lead exposure caused reductions of NR2A mRNA levels (11.9-19.3%) in the pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampus at 14 and 21 days of age. NR1 mRNA levels were also significantly increased (14.0%) in the cerebellum of 28-day-old rats with no change in NR2A mRNA at any age. No significant changes in subunit mRNA levels were present in cortical or subcortical regions at any age. The Pb-induced changes in hippocampal NMDA receptor subunit mRNA expression measured in the present study may lead to modifications in receptor levels or subtypes and alter the development of defined neuronal connections which require NMDA receptor activation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the hippocampus, ten minutes of transient global ischemia results in the death of CA1 pyramidal cells after a period of one to three days. The neurons in the CA1 region constitutively express NADPH-D (NADPH diaphorase activity). In contrast, astrocytes in the hippocampus do not normally express NADPH-D; but a population of reactive astrocytes (GFAP+ cells) begin to express of NADPH-D one day after transient global ischemia. NADPH-D is thought to be a histological marker for Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS), the enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of NO, a potent neurotoxin. We suggest that this increase in NADPH-D/NOS expression is an important element in the sequence of changes that occurs after ischemia, and that NO derived from reactive astrocytes or from neurons may play a causal role in neural cell death after ischemia in the hippocampus.',\n",

Receptor transcripts in brains from two males and two females (mean age +/- S.D. = 70 +/- 4 years; post-mortem interval = 29 +/- 6 h) were visualised with 35S-radiolabelled synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleic acid probes. In the hippocampus, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was present in all fields, especially CA1. In the parahippocampal gyrus and neocortical regions 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was enhanced in superficial and middle laminae. 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was particularly abundant in the raphe and other serotonergic cell groups of the brainstem. The analysis of emulsion dipped sections showed 5-HT1A receptor mRNA to be concentrated in pyramidal neurons, together with the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In neocortical areas lamina III pyramidal neurons were more heavily labelled than those in lamina V. There was no evidence of glial expression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in grey matter or white matter compartments. 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was present in all neocortical areas examined, where it was located in pyramidal neurons, of lamina V more than in those of lamina III, as well as in putative interneurons, especially within lamina IVc of the striate cortex. 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was observed at minimal levels in the hippocampus and not in the raphe. Neither 5-HT1A nor 5-HT2A receptor mRNA were detected in the cerebellum, substantia nigra or striatum. The ability to detect these transcripts at the regional and cellular level will help reveal important details of the 5-HT receptor system in the human brain. This includes the investigation of their putative roles in the normal chemoarchitecture and in pathophysiological brain processes.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor is localized predominantly on axon terminals.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor is a serotonin receptor subtype which is expressed predominantly in the basal ganglia. It has been suggested to play a role in movement and appetite control as well as in certain pathological states such as migraine. The recent cloning of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B gene as well as the discovery of a radioligand that labels in rodents 5-hydroxytryptamine1B and possibly 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha receptors (S-CM-G[125I]TNH2) allowed us to compare the distribution of the messenger RNA and of the protein in mouse brain sections. A high 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA level is found in the caudate-putamen in medium spiny neurons that project to the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. In contrast, no messenger RNA is expressed in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra although these structures reveal the highest level of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding sites. In the hippocampus, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA is localized in the cell bodies of pyramidal cells of the CA1 field while the protein is found predominantly in the dorsal subiculum, a projection zone for the CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the cerebellum, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA is expressed in the Purkinje cells, which display no receptor binding sites. Conversely, moderate binding is found in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum, the main projection zone of the Purkinje cells. 5-Hydroxytryptamine1B sites are also detected in the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, brain regions containing the terminals of retinal ganglion cells. The soma of these ganglion cells express high levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA while no 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding sites were found in the retina. This study demonstrates that the main brain regions, expressing 5-hydroxytrypamine1B messenger RNA contain low densities of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding sites. Conversely, the major projection areas of these anatomical structures do not express detectable levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B messenger RNA, but present a high density of binding sites. In addition, our data suggest that the distribution of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha binding sites is different from that of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha messenger RNA. These results together with previous lesion studies, indicate that the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B and possibly the 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha receptors are localized predominantly on axon terminals, while their expression is low or absent at the somatodendritic level. The 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha proteins might therefore contain an addressing signal allowing their transport toward nerve endings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainic acid (KA) induces status epilepticus and delayed neurodegeneration of CA3 hippocampal neurons. Downregulation of glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) subunit mRNA [the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) subunit that limits Ca2+ permeability] is thought to a play role in this neurodegeneration, possibly by increased formation of Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptors. The present study examined early hippocampal decreases in GluR2 mRNA and protein following kainate-induced status epilepticus and correlated expression changes with the appearance of dead or dying cells by several histological procedures. At 12 h, in situ hybridization followed by emulsion dipping showed nonuniform decreases in GluR2 mRNA hybridization grains overlying morphologically healthy-appearing CA3 neurons. GluR1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mRNAs were unchanged. At 12-16 h, when little argyrophilia or cells with some features of apoptosis were detected by silver impregnation or electron microscopy, single immunohistochemistry with GluR2 and GluR2/3 subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated a pattern of decreased GluR2 receptor protein within CA3 neurons that appeared to predict a pattern of damage, similar to the mRNA observations. Double immunolabeling showed that GluR2 immunofluorescence was depleted and that GluR1 immunofluorescence was sustained in clusters of the same CA3 neurons. Quantitation of Western blots showed increased GluR1:GluR2 ratios in CA3 but not in CA1 or dentate gyrus subfields. Findings indicate that the GluR1:GluR2 protein ratio is increased in a population of CA3 neurons prior to significant cell loss. Data are consistent with the \"GluR2 hypothesis\" that reduced expression of GluR2 subunits will increase formation of AMPA receptors permeable to Ca2+ and predict vulnerability to a particular subset of pyramidal neurons following status epilepticus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'TMEFF1 and TMEFF2 are putative transmembrane proteins comprised of one epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and two follistatin-like domains. Both TMEFF1 and TMEFF2 are predominantly expressed in the brain. We previously demonstrated that recombinant TMEFF2 protein can promote survival of neurons in primary culture and determined expression sites of TMEFF2 mRNA in the mouse central nervous system. To extend our understanding of TMEFF protein functions, we compared precise sites of expression of TMEFF1 and TMEFF2 mRNA using in situ hybridization analysis. Although both TMEFF genes are widely expressed in the brain, they exhibit different patterns of expression. TMEFF1 showed comparatively higher signals in the pyramidal cells of fifth layer of the cerebral neocortex, CA3, CA1 and subiculum regions of the hippocampus, locus coeruleus, and dentate cerebellar nucleus. In contrast, TMEFF2 is highly expressed in the medial habenular, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus, corpus callosum, cerebellar cortex and cranial nerve nuclei (III, IV, VII, X, XII). The results presented here indicate that expression of TMEFF1 and TMEFF2 are regulated differently and that they play region-specific roles in the central nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors consist of different subunits, alpha and beta, with different subtype arrangement corresponding to distinct pharmacological and functional properties. The expression of alpha 3, alpha 7 and beta 2 mRNA in the human brain was studied by in situ hybridization and compared to [3H]nicotine, [3H]cytisine and [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding in contiguous sections. The beta 2 probe showed a strong hybridization signal in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the CA2/CA3 region of the hippocampus and in the insular cortex, and a signal of lower intensity in the subicular complex and entorhinal cortex. The alpha 3 probe showed strong hybridization in the dorsomedial, lateral posterior, ventroposteromedial and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, and a weak signal in the hippocampal region and in the entorhinal, insular and cingular cortex. The amount of alpha 7 mRNA was high at the level of the dentate granular layer and the CA2/CA3 region of the hippocampus, in the caudate nucleus and in the pulvinar and ventroposterolateral nuclei of the thalamus. [3H]Nicotine and [3H]cytisine binding appeared to be identical in anatomical distribution and relative intensity. It was high in the thalamic nuclei, the putamen and in the hippocampal formation in the subicular complex and the stratum lacunosum moleculare. The level of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding was particularly high in the hippocampus and in the pyramidal cells of the CA1 region, but was relatively low in the subicular complex. Our data indicate that in the human brain nicotinic receptor subtypes have discrete distributions, which are in part different from those of other species.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Although glutamatergic receptors are localized throughout the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the specific cellular localization of the various glutamatergic receptor subtypes throughout human brain remains largely unknown. PCR fragments to human GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 receptor subtypes were cloned and used as probes for in situ hybridization in order to examine the anatomical and cellular localization of glutamate receptor subtype gene expression in dissected regions of human postmortem brain tissue. Although hybridization was observed throughout the CNS, results indicated that the highest levels of hybridization were in the hippocampus, with localization primarily to cells in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1-CA3 region, and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus. Prominent hybridization also was observed in the medium to large neurons of the cingulate cortex, temporal lobe, septum, and amygdala, as well as in scattered neurons in the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and medulla. A striking pattern of differential hybridization was observed within the cerebellum. GluR1 demonstrated light hybridization along the Purkinje/Bergmann glia layer, with GluR2 and GluR3 demonstrating hybridization to Purkinje cells, and GluR3 also to cells within the molecular layer, previously identified as stellate-basket cells. Changes in glutamate receptor function have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological disorders. Therefore, an examination of glutamatergic receptor expression in human postmortem brain tissue may provide important information on the molecular basis of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders of the CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recently, we demonstrated that transient forebrain ischemia in rats leads to an early and strong induction of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) synthesis in astrocytes in the injured brain regions. In this study, in order to clarify the targets of such raised endogenous bFGF levels, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of its receptors (flg and bek) in the hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min was investigated using an in situ hybridization technique. Transient forebrain ischemia induced an increase in the number of flg mRNA-positive cells from an early stage (24 h after ischemia) in the hippocampal CA1 subfield where delayed neuronal death occurred later (48-72 h after ischemia). This increase became more marked with the progression of neuronal death and was still evident in the same area 30 days later. The time course of the appearance and distribution pattern of flg mRNA-positive cells in the CA1 subfield were quite similar to those of bFGF mRNA-positive cells. On the other hand, in situ hybridization for bek mRNA showed only slight and transient (observed 72 h and 5 days after ischemia) increases in the number of mRNA-positive cells in the CA1 subfield following ischemia. The use of in situ hybridization and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry in combination demonstrated that the cells in the CA1 subfield that exhibited ischemia-induced flg or bek mRNA expression were astrocytes. These data indicate that transient forebrain ischemia induces upregulation of fibroblast growth factor-receptor expression, accompanied by increased bFGF expression in astrocytes, and suggest that the increased astrocytic bFGF levels in injured brain regions act on the astrocytes via autocrine systems and are involved in the development and maintenance of astrocytosis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The 5-HT5A receptor is a member of a new subfamily of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptors recently cloned from the human and rodent brain. The role of this receptor in normal brain functions as well as its possible involvement in pathological states is still to be determined. We therefore studied the regional distribution and cellular localization of 5-HT5A receptor mRNA in human brain sections from autopsy samples by in situ hybridization histochemistry, in order to obtain anatomical information which might be useful in formulating hypotheses on possible functions subserved by this receptor in the central nervous system (CNS). Our results showed that the main sites of 5-HT5A mRNA expression were the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In the neocortical regions, the 5-HT5A receptor mRNA was mainly distributed in the layers II-III and V-VI. In the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 and CA3 fields expressed 5-HT5A mRNA at high levels. The broad distribution in the neocortex and hippocampus supports the view that the 5-HT5A receptor in these areas might be implicated in high cortical and limbic functions. The 5-HT5A mRNA was widely distributed in the cerebellum where it was highly expressed in the Purkinje cells, in the dentate nucleus and, at a lower level, in the granule cells. Since the cerebellum receives diffuse serotonergic afferents, this finding suggests that the 5-HT5A receptor may have an important role in mediating the effects of 5-HT on cerebellar functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Small unilateral electrolytic lesions placed in the hilus of the dentate gyrus produce limbic seizures. We have investigated the effects of these hilar lesions on the levels of the mRNAs encoding for 3 neurotrophic factors (NTF): nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3). 'In situ' hybridization histochemistry with synthetic oligonucleotides was used to analyze their mRNA distribution and levels. In agreement with previously published data (Science, 245 (1989) 758-761), NGF mRNA was found bilaterally, quickly and transiently increased in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Only 2 h after the onset of limbic seizures, mRNA levels for BDNF were also found to be dramatically elevated in both sides of the hippocampus, reaching a maximum 30-fold increase in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus 5 h after the lesion. Moreover, increased levels of this mRNA were also been found in the pyramidal layer of the CA3 (5-fold) and CA1 (15-fold) hippocampal fields. In contrast, NT3 mRNA was found to be clearly and bilaterally decreased in dentate gyrus granule cells, reaching 5- to 6-fold decreased levels at 12 h after lesion. Taken together, these results clearly show a different regulation of neurotrophic factors genes (NGF, BDNF and NT3) expression in the different hippocampal fields, as a consequence of seizure-producing hilar lesions.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential regulation of the expression of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 mRNAs in adult rat brain after intrahippocampal injection of quinolinic acid.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Intrahippocampal injection of the endogenous excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN) induces seizures together with local, delayed neurodegeneration in specific cell layers. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to study the spatio-temporal pattern of expression of neurotrophins (NTFs) after this treatment. As in other excitatory paradigms, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels increased dramatically and transiently in dentate gyrus after the administration of 120 nmol of QUIN to the left hippocampus. BDNF, but not NGF, mRNA also increased in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer, mainly in the CA1 field. Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) mRNA levels decreased in dentate gyrus, practically disappeared around 12 h after the insult and returned to basal levels four days later. A very different pattern of expression of NTFs was found locally: (a) upregulation of NGF and BDNF mRNAs expression was prevented in a spherical region of 1-2 mm diameter around the injection site, (b) a delayed increase in NT3 mRNA levels, beginning at 12 h and lasting for at least 4 days after the administration of QUIN, was found in the same region, in cell layers showing neurodegeneration. Pretreatment with the non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 (2 mg/kg, 30 min before the insult), partially blocked the increase in both BDNF and NGF mRNAs, as well as the decrease in NT3, in the contralateral hippocampus. However, this treatment did not prevent the QUIN-induced local downregulation of NGF and BDNF. Treatment with the AMPA/kainate antagonist NBQX (30 mg/kg, 15 and 5 min before, and 10 min after the insult) did not influence the effect of QUIN upon NGF or BDNF mRNA levels, although it partially prevented the hippocampal contralateral decrease in NT3 mRNA. In conclusion, the present study strongly supports previous work concerning different regulation of BDNF/NGF respect to NT3 in seizure inducing paradigms. Moreover, the different and to some extent opposite regulation of NTFs in the hippocampal region contiguous to the injection site, respect to the remaining hippocampus, suggests a differential regulation of NTFs in QUIN-induced neurodegenerative and seizural processes. Finally, our pharmacological data, (i) show that the upregulation of NGF and BDNF mRNAs, indirectly induced by QUIN, is not mediated by AMPA receptors, and (ii) suggest other effects for QUIN, apart from the stimulation of NMDA receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The relative postmortem stability of the mRNA's for glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor in rodent brain was determined using semi-quantitative in situ hybridization (ISH). Rats were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and their brains removed immediately (0 h) or following 12 h or 24 h delays. Specific hybridization of GR and MR anti-sense [35S]RNA-probe to tissue mRNA encoding these receptors was detected using film and emulsion autoradiography. The most intense labeling for GR mRNA was in the dentate gyrus followed by the CA1 hippocampal region. Lower, but still detectable signal, was apparent over CA3-CA4 pyramidal cell regions. MR mRNA was detected throughout the CA1-4 pyramidal cell fields of the hippocampus and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus. Film images demonstrated that even in the 24 h postmortem delay group intense specific signal was present in sections hybridized with both anti-sense GR and MR probes, although there was some diminution in signal intensity in cortical areas at this later postmortem delay. These initial experiments with rat brain demonstrate that the mRNA's for both GR and MR, as detected with ISH, are stable for up to 24 h following death.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential expression of the 61 kDa and 63 kDa calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterases in the mouse brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Based on their relative abundance and regulation by Ca2+ and by phosphorylation in vitro, it is thought that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterases (CaM-PDEs) are important modulators of cyclic nucleotide function in the brain. Two of the most abundant CaM-PDEs in the brain are the 61 kDa and 63 kDa isozymes. In this study, the regional and cellular expression of mRNA encoding these two different isoforms in mouse brain has been determined by in situ hybridization. The 63 kDa CaM-PDE mRNA has a wide-spread but uneven distribution. Very strong hybridization signals are present in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Somewhat lesser amounts of 63 kDa CaM-PDE mRNA are present in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex. Weaker but still easily discernible hybridization signals are seen in several layers of the cerebral cortex, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, amygdaloid nuclear complex, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. A weak hybridization signal was detected in the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia. In general, the distribution of the 63 kDa CaM-PDE is very similar to that of dopamine receptors, suggesting that it may modulate dopamine function. In contrast, the 61 kDa CaM-PDE mRNA has a more limited and much different distribution, with the highest level of expression in the cerebral cortex and in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. A moderate hybridization signal was detected in the medial habenula and amygdaloid nuclear complex. In addition, small subsets of neurons in several other regions showed specific hybridization. Both PDE mRNAs appear to be localized exclusively in neuronal cell bodies. Their distinct distribution suggests important but different physiological roles for these two isozymes in the regional regulation of cyclic nucleotides in the CNS. Since these two isozymes are differentially phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, the differential expression also provides a potential mechanism by which these PDEs can differentially regulate cAMP and cGMP in different brain areas. The high expression levels in specific subsets of neurons also suggest that agents increasing Ca2+ in these neurons will increase the rate of cyclic nucleotide degradation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization histochemistry for somatostatin receptors-1, -2, -3 and -4 section and receptor autoradiography using [125I]CGP 23996, [125I]somatostatin-28, [125I]seglitide and [125I]Tyr3 octreotide were carried out to determine the expression of somatostatin receptor messenger RNAs and binding sites in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats 21 days following generalized limbic seizures induced by subcutaneous injection of 12mg/kg kainic acid. In control rats, somatostatin-1 to somatostatin-4 receptor messenger RNAs were found in the pyramidal layer and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. After kainate treatment, the CA1 subfield displayed a selective decrease in somatostatin-3 and somatostatin-4 receptor hybridization signals of 35 and 41%, respectively, whereas no changes were observed in the remaining hippocampal areas. Somatostatin-1 and somatostatin-2 receptor messenger RNA expression in the hippocampus remained unaffected by kainate treatment. No effect of kainate was observed in the expression of somatostatin receptor messenger RNAs in the cerebral cortex. In control rats, the selective somatostatin-2 receptor ligands, [125I]seglitide and [125I]Tyr3 octreotide and the non-selective somatostatin receptor ligands [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I]somatostatin-28, labelled preferentially the stratum oriens and radiatum CA1, the granule and molecular layers of the dentate gyrus and the deep layers of the cerebral cortex. [125I]somatostatin-28 and [125I]CGP 23996 labelled sites were selectively decreased by 32 and 39%, respectively, in the stratum radiatum CA1 after kainate treatment. [125I]CGP 23996 binding was also decreased by 35% in the stratum oriens CA1 and by 36% on average in the stratum oriens and radiatum CA3. [125I]seglitide and [125I]Tyr3 octreotide binding was not affected by kainate in any hippocampal region. The granule and molecular layers of the hippocampus and the layers IV-VI of the cerebral cortex did not show changes in binding sites for any of the radioligands analysed. A 18 and 35% decrease in the spontaneous and 50 mM KCl-induced somatostatin release from hippocampal slices was found two days after kainate, a likely reflection of neuronal cell loss. No differences in somatostatin release were observed 21 days after kainate treatment. At this latter time, the rats had an enhanced susceptibility to tonic-clonic seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol, a subconvulsant dose in naive rats. Bilateral infusion of 6 micrograms RC 160, a selective somatostatin-2 receptor agonist, in the dentate gyrus 21 days after kainate, significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the number of animals with tonic-clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Thymosin beta 4 is a protein expressed in most rodent and human tissues, including the brain, and is thought to participate in neurite outgrowth during development by sequestration of G-actin necessary for growth cone extension. Under normal conditions in the adult rat brain, the gene has been suggested to be expressed in microglia and CA1-CA2 hippocampal pyramidal cells. Here we show by using in situ hybridization that t beta 4 is dramatically up-regulated in the infarcted brain area after focal ischaemia. In addition, moderate t beta 4 induction is detected in the perifocal zone, substantia nigra and CA1-CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurones. Macrophages are probably responsible for t beta 4 induction in the infarcted region, and activated non-neuronal cells probably contribute to the induction seen in the thalamus, substantia nigra and perifocal zone. However, the pyramidal neurones in the hippocampus show t beta 4, upregulation which may be related to restoration of neurite circuits after focal ischemic damage.',\n",

We have analyzed the expression of murin bcl6 in pre- and postnatal mouse using in situ hybridization histochemistry and Northern blotting. The developing olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity was the only tissue displaying a positive bcl6 mRNA signal in the day 14 embryo. At gestational day 17, expression was primarily seen in skeletal muscle, olfactory epithelium, and thymus, and also in the epithelium lining the upper airways and esophagus. In selected tissues from postnatal mouse, bcl6 expression was detected in brain, renal cortex, spleen, and thymus. The expression in brain was restricted to the pyramidal cell layer of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus regions CA1 and CA2, and the dentate gyrus. Our results show that bcl6 expression is not confined only to organs of the lymphatic system, such as spleen and thymus. Thus, bcl6 may be active as a regulator of gene transcription in many different cell types, including epithelial and nerve cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainic acid-induced seizures in rats represent an established animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy. However, it is well-known that behavioral responses to the systemic administration of kainic acid are inconsistent between animals. In this study, we examined the relationship between expression of genes, neuropathological damage, and behavioral changes (seizure intensity and body temperature) in rats after systemic administration of kainic acid. The considerable differences in the response to kainic acid-induced seizures were observed in rats after a single administration of kainic acid (12 mg/kg i.p.). There was no detection of the expression of heat shock protein hsp-70 mRNA and HSP-70 protein in brain of vehicle-treated controls and in animals exhibiting weak behavioral changes (stage 1-2). A moderate expression of hsp-70 mRNA was detected throughout all regions (the pyramidal cell layers of CA1-3 and dentate gyrus) of the hippocampus, the basolateral, lateral, central and medial amygdala, the piriform cortex, and the central medial thalamic nucleus of rats that developed moderate seizures (stage 3-4). Marked expression of hsp-70 mRNA was detected in the all regions (cingulate, parietal, somatosensory, insular, entorhinal, piriform cortices) of cerebral cortex and all regions of hippocampus, and the central medial thalamic nucleus of the rats that developed severe seizures (stage 4-5). In addition, marked HSP-70 immunoreactivity was detected in the pyramidal cell layers of CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus, all regions (cingulate, parietal, somatosensory, insular, piriform cortices) of cerebral cortex, and the striatum of rats that developed severe seizures (stage 4-5). Furthermore, a marked expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels by kainic acid-induced behavioral seizures (stage 3-4 or stage 4-5) was detected in all hippocampal pyramidal cell layers, granule layers of dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, neocortex, and amygdala. The present study suggest that the behavioral changes (seizure intensity and body temperature) and neuropathological damage after systemic administration of kainic acid are inconsistent between animals, and that these behavioral changes (severity of kainic acid-induced limbic seizures) might be correlated with gene expression of hsp-70 mRNA, COX-2 mRNA, and BDNF mRNA in rat brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The excitatory, glutamatergic granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus are presumed to play central roles in normal learning and memory, and in the genesis of spontaneous seizure discharges that originate within the temporal lobe. In localizing the two GABA-producing forms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) in the normal hippocampus as a prelude to experimental epilepsy studies, we unexpectedly discovered that, in addition to its presence in hippocampal nonprincipal cells, GAD67-like immunoreactivity (LI) was present in the excitatory axons (the mossy fibers) of normal dentate granule cells of rats, mice, and the monkey Macaca nemestrina. Using improved immunocytochemical methods, we were also able to detect GABA-LI in normal granule cell somata and processes. Conversely, GAD65-LI was undetectable in normal granule cells. Perforant pathway stimulation for 24 hours, which evoked population spikes and epileptiform discharges in both dentate granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, induced GAD65-, GAD67-, and GABA-LI only in granule cells. Despite prolonged excitation, normally GAD- and GABA-negative dentate hilar neurons and hippocampal pyramidal cells remained immunonegative. Induced granule cell GAD65-, GAD67-, and GABA-LI remained elevated above control immunoreactivity for at least 4 days after the end of stimulation. Pre-embedding immunocytochemical electron microscopy confirmed that GAD67- and GABA-LI were induced selectively within granule cells; granule cell layer glia and endothelial cells were GAD- and GABA-immunonegative. In situ hybridization after stimulation revealed a similarly selective induction of GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA in dentate granule cells. Neurochemical analysis of the microdissected dentate gyrus and area CA1 determined whether changes in GAD- and GABA-LI reflect changes in the concentrations of chemically identified GAD and GABA. Stimulation for 24 hours increased GAD67 and GABA concentrations sixfold in the dentate gyrus, and decreased the concentrations of the GABA precursors glutamate and glutamine. No significant change in GAD65 concentration was detected in the microdissected dentate gyrus despite the induction of GAD65-LI. The concentrations of GAD65, GAD67, GABA, glutamate and glutamine in area CA1 were not significantly different from control concentrations. These results indicate that dentate granule cells normally contain two \"fast-acting\" amino acid neurotransmitters, one excitatory and one inhibitory, and may therefore produce both excitatory and inhibitory effects. Although the physiological role of granule cell GABA is unknown, the discovery of both basal and activity-dependent GAD and GABA expression in glutamatergic dentate granule cells may have fundamental implications for physiological plasticity presumed to underlie normal learning and memory. Furthermore, the induction of granule cell GAD and GABA by afferent excitation may constitute a mechanism by which epileptic seizures trigger compensatory interictal network inhibition or GABA-mediated neurotrophic effects.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Altered synaptophysin expression as a marker of synaptic pathology in schizophrenia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'It has been proposed that synaptic density or synaptic innervation may be altered in schizophrenia as a correlate of the neurodevelopmental pathology of the disease. Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle protein whose distribution and abundance provides a synaptic marker which can be reliably measured in post mortem brain. We have used in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunoreactivity to assess the expression of synaptophysin messenger RNA and protein respectively in medial temporal lobe from seven schizophrenics and 13 controls. In the schizophrenic cases, synaptophysin messenger RNA was reduced bilaterally in CA4, CA3, subiculum and parahippocampal gyrus, with a similar trend in dentate gyrus but no change in CA1. It was also decreased in terms of grains per pyramidal neuron in the affected subfields. In parahippocampal gyrus, the loss of synaptophysin messenger RNA per neuron in schizophrenia was greater in deep than superficial laminae. A parallel study in rats showed no effect of haloperidol treatment upon hippocampal synaptophysin messenger RNA, suggesting that neuroleptic treatment does not underlie the reductions found in schizophrenia. In the right medial temporal lobe of schizophrenics, we confirmed the correlation of synaptophysin messenger RNA abundance between ipsilateral subfields seen in both hemispheres of control brains. However, these correlations were not observed in the left medial temporal lobe of the schizophrenic cases. Synaptophysin immunoreactivity in schizophrenia showed no significant differences in any subfield compared to controls. Our data support the broad hypothesis that synaptic pathology occurs in schizophrenia. In so far as synaptophysin expression is a marker for synaptic density, the data suggest that pyramidal neurons within the medial temporal lobe may form fewer synapses. However, the lack of any significant differences in synaptophysin immunoreactivity despite the loss of encoding messenger RNA means that this conclusion must be drawn cautiously. There are several plausible explanations for the preservation of synaptophysin immunoreactivity despite reductions in transcript abundance; one possibility is that the inferrred loss of synapses occurs in extra-hippocampal sites to which the affected pyramidal neurons project. For example, the reduction in synaptophysin messenger RNA in subicular neurons may be accompanied by decreased density of synaptic terminals in the nucleus accumbens. Such differences in the efferent synaptic connectivity of the hippocampus have previously been hypothesized to be an important component of the circuitry underlying schizophrenia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We report on the characterization of the novel rat brain protein dendrin which is encoded by the brain-specific transcript 464. On immunoblots, two protein variants (81 kD, 89 kD) were identified in cytosolic and membraneous protein fractions. The variants are most abundant in the hippocampus, notably in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. Dendritic and perikaryal immunolabelling is apparent in neurons of the cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, and preoptic areas. In cortical and hippocampal dendrites, electron-dense immunoreaction is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, the plasma membrane, and spine heads. An association of dendrin with polyribosomes and the presence of its mRNA in dendrites both provide evidence for dendritic mRNA translation. In the rat forebrain, dendrin expression is altered after an extended period of wakefulness. Twenty-four-hour sleep deprivation decreases the mRNA and protein concentrations of both variants in subcortical forebrain plus midbrain areas by 24 +/- 11% (P < 0.05) and 40 +/- 14% (P < 0.1), respectively, as measured relative to beta-actin mRNA and neural actin. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, the relative mRNA level remains unchanged whereas the cortical protein concentration is reduced by 42 +/- 10% (P < 0.05). Thus, dendrin belongs to a new class of dendritic proteins whose expression is differentially modulated by prolonged behavioral activity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase mRNA levels show marked and region-specific changes in the early phase after transient forebrain ischemia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Considerable evidence points to an involvement of natural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) in trophic regulation of brain tissue. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase is the key enzyme in the interconversion pathway which leads to the formation of spermidine and putrescine from spermine and spermidine, respectively. In the present paper we have studied using in situ hybridization histochemistry the levels of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase mRNA in the rat central nervous system after transient forebrain ischemia. In the first hours after the insult, a modest increase in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase mRNA levels was observed in ependymal cells and other non-neuronal cells of all telencephalic and diencephalic regions. In addition, major increases in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase mRNA levels were observed in regions selectively vulnerable to the ischemic insult, such as striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex, during the first day post-reperfusion. The time course and extent of labelling increase were subregion- and cell-specific. At the cellular level, the labelling appeared markedly increased in neurons (8-10 fold in ventromedial striatum and CA1 region) and, to a lesser extent, in non-neuronal cells. The increase in SSAT mRNA levels was not directly related to cell degeneration, as it was detected in both some vulnerable and some resistant cell populations. However, the peak increase of SSAT labelling was precocious in resistant neurons (such as those of ventromedial striatum and dentate gyrus granular layer) and delayed or very limited in vulnerable neurons (such as those of CA1 pyramidal layer and dorsolateral striatum). The increase in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase may contribute to the increase in putrescine and decrease in spermidine levels observed after ischemia and gives further support to the notion that polyamine metabolism in the early phase after lesion is oriented towards putrescine production. This phenomenon could be relevant in determining the prevalence of neurotrophic vs. neurotoxic effects of polyamines.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Excitotoxic activation of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is thought to be a key event for the molecular pathogenesis of postischemic delayed neuronal death in CA1 hippocampus. To assess a possible interference of ischemia with NMDA receptor expression, transcription of the NMDA receptor 1 (NMDA-R1) gene was examined by in situ hybridization in the gerbil brain after 5 min of global ischemia and various recirculation intervals. In normal gerbil brain, NMDA-R1 was strongly expressed and equally abundant in CA1 and CA3 neurons. After ischemia, expression remained unchanged for 24 h, followed by a selective decline in mRNA levels in CA1 neurons, resulting in the complete disappearance of hybridization signals after 4 days. NMDA-R1 expression in forebrain neurons less vulnerable or resistant to ischemia including CA3 and dentate granule cells remained unchanged. Similar in situ data were obtained for the beta subunit of the inhibitory glycine receptor (Gly-R). This subunit is also abundantly expressed in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, but not known to be involved in the mechanisms of post-ischemic excitotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Several lines of evidence underscore a possible role of voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaCH) in epilepsy. We compared the regional distribution of mRNAs coding for Na+ channel alpha subunit I, II and III in brains from control and kainate-treated rats using non-radioactive in situ hybridization with subtype-specific digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes. Labelling intensity was evaluated by a densitometric analysis of digitized images. Heterogeneous distribution of the three Na+ channel mRNAs was demonstrated in brain from adult control rats, which confirmed previous studies. Subtype II mRNAs were shown to be abundant in cerebellum and hippocampus. Subtype I mRNAs were also detected in these areas. Subtype III mRNAs were absent in cerebellar cortex, but significantly expressed in neurons of the medulla oblongata and hippocampus. The three subtypes were differentially distributed in neocortical layers. Subtype II mRNAs were present in all of the layers, but mRNAs for subtypes I and III were concentrated in pyramidal cells of neocortex layers IV-V. During kainate-induced seizures, we observed an increase in Na+ channel II and III mRNA levels in hippocampus. In dentate gyrus, subtype III mRNAs increased 3 h after KA administration to a maximum at 6 h. At this latter time, a lower increase in NaCh III mRNAs was also recorded in areas CA1 and CA3. NaCh III overexpression in dentate gyrus persisted for at least 24 h. In the same area, NaCh II mRNAs were also increased with a peak 3 h after KA injection and a return to control levels by 24 h. No changes in NaCh I mRNAs were seen. The KA-induced up-regulation in NaCh mRNAs probably resulted in an increase in hippocampal neuronal excitability.',\n",

Quantitatively, liver is the major drug metabolizing organ, however metabolism of drugs in brain could modulate pharmacological and pharmacodynamic effects of psychoactive drugs at their site of action and explain some of the variation typically seen in patient population. We have measured cytochrome P450 content and examined constitutive expression of CYP2D mRNA and protein in human brain regions by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Northern and immunoblotting and localized it by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. CYP2D mRNA was expressed constitutively in neurons of cerebral cortex, Purkinje and granule cell layers of cerebellum, reticular neurons of midbrain and pyramidal neurons of CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus. Immunoblot studies demonstrated the presence of cytochrome P4502D protein in cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, striatum and thalamus of human brain. Immunohistochemical localization showed the predominant presence of cytochrome P4502D not only in neuronal soma but also in dendrites of Purkinje and cortical neurons. These studies demonstrate constitutive expression of cytochrome P4502D in neuronal cell population in human brain, indicating its possible role in metabolism of psychoactive drugs directly at or near their site of action, in neurons, in human brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The distribution of messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) for serotonin (5-HT) receptors of 1A, 2A and 1D alpha type (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT1D alpha) was examined and compared in autoptic human brain by means of in-situ hybridization using cRNA probes, in those areas with the highest density of the receptors, as observed with binding techniques. The results showed that the 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was abundantly expressed in the layers II-VI of all cortical areas under examination, but the highest expression was found in the hippocampus, particularly in the granular cells of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the Hammon's horn. The 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was mainly present in the layers III-V of the cortex, with regional differences which were particularly marked in the striate area where the layer IV was specifically labeled. On the other hand, in the hippocampus, 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was restricted to the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 field of the Hammon's horn. No expression of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1D alpha receptors was detected in the caudate nucleus and in putamen where only a light labeling by means of the 5-HT1A receptor probe was detected. The 5-HT1D alpha receptor mRNA was found only in the CA3 field of the Hammon's horn. These findings confirm that 5-HT receptors are widely distributed in the brain, but that the different subtypes possess a selective localization in different neuronal populations which, in turn, may express one or more receptors. The regional differences may represent the anatomical substrate of different serotonergic functions and dysfunctions.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Increased expression of GAD mRNA during the chronic epileptic syndrome due to intrahippocampal tetanus toxin.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'A few mouse minimum lethal doses (MLD) of tetanus toxin injected into rat hippocampus triggers prolonged changes in neuronal function. Spontaneously recurring epileptic discharges arise in both the injected and the contralateral, uninjected hippocampus. The seizures remit after about 6 weeks, to be succeeded by a permanent depression of hippocampal neuronal responses. There is no evidence of any loss of pyramidal cells at this low dose of toxin. Here we studied presumptive inhibitory, GABAergic neurons, using in situ hybridization (ISH) with a probe directed against the mRNA encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), at each of 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after injection of tetanus toxin. Epileptic activity was recorded from hippocampal slices prepared from both injected and contralateral hippocampi of rats at each time point, unexpectedly persisting until 8 weeks. There were no significant differences in the numbers of neurons containing GAD mRNA between toxin- and vehicle-injected and control rats in any hippocampal subfield, at any survival time, except for an apparently transient loss of hilar signal in vehicle-injected rats at 1 and 2 weeks which we attribute to a significant, transient loss of neuronal GAD mRNA to below the threshold for detection by ISH using this probe. In contrast there was a marked increase in GAD mRNA in the toxin-injected group, which reached a peak at 4 weeks, and returned to control levels by 8 weeks. The changes were bilateral and were most marked in the hilus of the dentate area, but were also significant in CA3 and CA1. Upregulation of GAD mRNA was preceded by an increase in the levels of the mRNA for the alpha subunit of the GTP binding protein, Gs (Gs alpha), at 2 weeks which affected the GABAergic neurons selectively, and not the pyramidal or granule cells. These marked changes in GAD mRNA may contribute to putative adaptive responses within GABAergic neurons, which would help contain epileptic activity in these chronic foci. The changes in GAD expression may be due to mechanisms acting through an increase in mRNA encoding Gs alpha.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) treatment in adult rats leads to limbic brain lesions that are detectable with classical neuropathological techniques 3 days after exposure. In particular, the hippocampal cells of the CA3c region are affected. The temporal and regional characteristics of TMT toxicity as reflected in changes of activity-dependent factors were studied in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using quantitative in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. No significant alterations in the BDNF mRNA were detected in hippocampus and cerebral cortex 1 and 4 h after 8 mg TMT/kg. Three days after TMT, a significant increase in BDNF mRNA was detected in CA1, and increases in BDNF mRNA were also seen in cortical layers. An increase in BDNF hybridization signal was seen over scattered neurons within and outside CA3c at 3 days. Four h after 8 mg TMT/kg, BDNF immunoreactivity was reduced in the pyramidal cells of the CA3c and CA1 regions as well as in the dentate gyrus. No significant change in BDNF immunoreactivity was seen in hippocampus or cerebral cortex 3 days after TMT. BDNF interacts with the high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase B (trkB). No immediate alteration in trkB mRNA was seen in hippocampus or cerebral cortex after 8 mg TMT/kg, while at 3 days trkB mRNA was significantly reduced in the CA3c pyramidal cell layer. No changes could be detected in neurotrophin-3 mRNA at either 1, 4 h or 3 days after TMT. Three days after 8 mg TMT/kg, a major induction of hsp70 mRNA occurred in a subset of neurons in the CA3c region, concomitant with an increased expression of c-fos mRNA as well as Fos protein in the hilar region of hippocampus. Hence, an early and transient decrease in BDNF appears to occur after TMT exposure, which is succeeded at 3 days by increases in BDNF, c-fos and hsp 70 mRNAs, concomitant with a decrease in trkB mRNA in regions known to be vulnerable to TMT. These results demonstrate that TMT causes a delayed, spatially restricted increase in activity-dependent gene expression, making TMT-induced disturbances an interesting model of neurodegenerative events.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Histological and ultrastructural localization of the kainate receptor subunits, KA2 and GluR6/7, in the rat nervous system using selective antipeptide antibodies.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Kainate receptors are found throughout many regions of the brain and presumably contribute to responses of neurons to glutamate and other excitatory amino acids. Two affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the kainate binding subunits, KA2 and GluR6, were made using C-terminus peptides. A previous study demonstrated that each antibody is specific for its subunit, although antibody to GluR6 recognizes GluR7 to some extent (hence the designation GluR6/7). Vibratome sections immunostained with either antibody showed light to moderate staining in many structures in the brain as well as in cervical spinal cord, dorsal root and vestibular ganglia, and pineal and pituitary glands. Moderate levels were seen in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, and hypothalamus, whereas much of the thalamus was stained lightly. In the hippocampus, CA3 pyramidal cells were stained more densely than CA1 pyramidal cells--the difference more evident with antibody to GluR6/7. In addition, neuropilar staining was densest in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. In the brainstem, staining was moderate to moderately dense in a number of sensory, motor, and reticular nuclei. The moderately dense staining in the reticulothalamic nucleus and pontine nuclei with antibody to GluR6/7 may represent its recognition of GluR7. In the cerebellum, staining was moderate in granular and molecular layers with antibody to KA2 and in the molecular layer with antibody to GluR6/7, whereas it was moderately dense to dense in the granular layer with the GluR6/7 antibody. Outside of the brain, densest staining was seen with antibody to KA2 in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. Ultrastructural localization of immunostaining was examined in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar cortex. Typically, major staining was in postsynaptic densities apposed by unstained presynaptic terminals with round or mainly round vesicles and in associated dendrites. The light microscope pattern of staining was fairly similar to that of previous [3H]kainate binding and in situ hybridization studies. In addition, comparison with previous studies on distribution of other types of glutamate receptors indicates that KA2 and GluR6/7 are found with various other subunits in many of the same cell populations throughout the nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (InsP3R1) in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) was studied by in situ hybridization. The receptor mRNAs were widely localized throughout the CNS, predominantly in the olfactory tubercle, cerebral cortex, CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, caudate putamen, and cerebellar Purkinje cells, where phosphoinositide turnover is known to be stimulated by various neurotransmitter receptors. In the most abundantly expressing Purkinje cells, InsP3R1 mRNA appeared to be translocated to the distal dendrites, since a strong hybridization density was observed in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. InsP3R protein is known to form tetrameric receptor-channel complex. Our preliminary hybridization data using probes for three distinct InsP3R subtypes showed preferential expression of InsP3R1 in many parts of the CNS. The expression of other receptor subtypes (InsP3R2 and InsP3R3) is less efficient, suggesting that a homotetramer formed of InsP3R1 subtype may play a central part in InsP3/Ca2+ signalling in the neuronal function, whereas a homotetramer of other subtypes and a possible heterotetramer among subtypes may be involved in differential InsP3/Ca2+ signalling. The chromosomal localization of the gene coding for InsP3R1 was confirmed on chromosome 6 but was found to be genetically independent of the Lurcher (Lc) mutation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin B (CSTB), are responsible for the primary defect in human progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1). CSTB inhibits the cathepsins B, H, L and S by tight reversible binding, but little is known regarding its localization and physiological function in the brain and the relation between the depletion of the CSTB protein and the clinical symptoms in EPM1. We have analysed the expression of mRNA and protein for CSTB in the adult rat brain using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. In the control brains, the CSTB gene was differentially expressed with the highest levels in the hippocampal formation and reticular thalamic nucleus, and moderate levels in amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and cortical areas. Detectable levels of CSTB were found in virtually all forebrain neurons but not in glial cells. Following 40 rapidly recurring seizures evoked by hippocampal kindling stimulations, CSTB mRNA expression showed marked bilateral increases in the dentate granule cell layer, CA1 and CA4 pyramidal layers, amygdala, and piriform and parietal cortices. Maximum levels were detected at 6 or 24 h, and expression had reached control values at 1 week post-seizures. The changes of mRNA expression were accompanied by transient elevations (at 6-24 h) of CSTB protein in the same brain areas. These findings demonstrate that seizure activity leads to rapid and widespread increases of the synthesis of CSTB in forebrain neurons. We propose that the upregulation of CSTB following seizures may counteract apoptosis by binding cysteine proteases.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synaptic mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability due to withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure were investigated in a hippocampal explant model system using electrophysiological techniques. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells demonstrated that acute ethanol exposure inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents by over 40%. Chronic ethanol exposure for 6 to 11 days at 35 or 75 mM induced no differences from control explants in the fast component of the population synaptic response (non-NMDAR-mediated). Prolonged field potential recordings (to 10 hr) were used to monitor the withdrawal process in vitro. Ethanol-exposed explants from both 35 and 75 mM groups displayed an increase (60% and 89%, respectively) in the NMDAR-mediated component of synaptic transmission on withdrawal from chronic exposure. Prolonged tonic-clonic electrographic seizure activity was consistently observed after ethanol withdrawal only after the increase in NMDAR function. This hyperexcitability was inhibited by the NMDAR antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and returned once the NMDAR component was reestablished after antagonist washout. In situ hybridization studies suggest that expression of NR2B subunit mRNA may be enhanced in explants after chronic ethanol exposure. No lasting differences were observed in the NMDAR component after acute in vitro ethanol exposure and withdrawal. These data suggest that the occurance of ethanol withdrawal hyperexcitability in this system may be directly dependent on alterations in NMDAR function after chronic exposure. Since this region and others that contain ethanol sensitive NMDARs may serve as epileptic foci, long term alterations in NMDAR function may be expected to generate paroxysmal depolarizing shifts underlying ictal events after withdrawal from ethanol exposure.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the hippocampus, glutamatergic pathways are altered following seizure activity or transient global ischemia, both pathological conditions leading to selective neuronal degeneration. Glutamatergic receptors, and notably alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolopropionate (AMPA) receptors, a family of glutamate receptors involved in fast synaptic transmission and in the maintenance of synaptic potentiation may play an important role in the pathological outcome. AMPA receptors are assembled from GluR-A, GluR-B, GluR-C and GluR-D polypeptides which exist in flop and flip variants, the latter allowing larger glutamate responses. Using in situ hybridization techniques, we show that kainate-induced epilepsy provokes a rapid but transient increase (50%) of GluR-B flip mRNA levels in all subregions of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus). This early phase is followed by a second, persistent GluR-B flip increase in regions in which neurons are known to be seizure-resistant (i.e. CA1 an dentate gyrus) while a 35% decrease is observed in the vulnerable CA3 area. Following global ischemia, the levels of GluR-B flip and flop variants are dramatically reduced (90-100%), well before any morphological signs of cell death, in the subiculum and CA1, two areas known to be particularly sensitive to ischemic insult. In keeping with the properties of GluR flip variants, it is suggested that altered subunit stoichiometry may lead to long-lasting enhanced efficiency of fast synaptic transmission in the epileptic hippocampus. Since GluR-B containing receptors are Ca2+ impermeable, our results also suggest altered Ca2+ permeability in the vulnerable pyramidal neurons of areas CA3 and CA1 in the epileptic and ischemic hippocampi, respectively.',\n",

At the dose previously shown to be neuroprotective dexmedetomidine inhibited the expression of c-fos and hsp70 mRNA, did not affect jun-B mRNA, and enhanced the induction of NGFI-A mRNA in the postischemic gerbil hippocampus. The reduced gene expression of c-fos and hsp70 was detected in the CA1 pyramidal cells which are prone to ischemic degeneration, whereas the increased gene expression of NGFI-A was measured from the CA3 and dentate gyrus, areas relatively resistant to ischemia.

       "  'Abstract': '1. This study was conducted to determine whether chronic psychosocial conflict alters the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in the hippocampus of male tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri). 2. To generate probes for the in situ hybridization, the tree shrew GR gene was partly cloned. There was a 90% homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned tree shrew GR and that of the corresponding human GR sequence. 35S-Labeled riboprobes which had been transcribed from the tree shrew GR clone hybridized to pyramidal neurons in all subregions of the tree shrew hippocampal formation and to granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. 3. After in situ hybridization, the expression of GR mRNA was semiquantitatively determined by counting silver grains over single neurons of the hippocampal formation of psychosocially stressed tree shrews and control animals. After 12 days of social conflict, the number of silver grains in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of stressed animals was significantly lower than in controls. No statistically significant differences in mRNA expression were observed in the pyramidal neurons of the subiculum and in the granule neurons of the dentate gyrus. 4. The present results suggest that psychosocial stress leads to a site-specific down-regulation of hippocampal GR via modification of mRNA expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is one of three structurally homologous natriuretic peptides present in heart and brain, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of water and salt intake, blood pressure, and hormone secretion. In the present study, the distribution of preproatrial natriuretic peptide (ppANP) mRNA in the central nervous system of the rat was examined by in situ hybridisation histochemistry by using [35S]-labelled oligonucleotides. Cells expressing ppANP mRNA were apparent in several major neuronal systems, being present in hypothalamic, limbic, pontine and forebrain olfactory regions. Relatively high densities of ppANP mRNA-positive neurones were found in the anterior medial preoptic hypothalamic nucleus, medial habenular nucleus, and in Barrington's nucleus in the pons. Moderate numbers of ppANP mRNA-positive cells were present in a number of amygdaloid nuclei, including the posterolateral and anterior cortical nuclei, in the zona incerta, and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Other areas, including the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, displayed only low densities of ppANP mRNA-positive neurones. A number of structures in which ppANP mRNA (or ANP-like immunoreactivity) has not previously been reported were found to contain moderate to high numbers of ppANP mRNA-positive neurones including several nuclei associated with the olfactory system, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus and neurones of the tenia tecta and ventrolateral orbital cortex. Although ppANP mRNA in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus has been described, we also detected labelling in CA2 and ventral CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Conversely, nuclei such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus of the solitary tract, which are reported to possess ANP-like immunoreactivity, were found not to contain ppANP mRNA. Overall, these results demonstrate the presence of ANP gene expression in discrete neuronal populations of the rat central nervous system and provide additional evidence to support a putative role for this peptide in regulating and integrating hypothalamic, olfactory, limbic, and neuroendocrine systems.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Gene expression of the axonal growth-associated protein, GAP-43, has been studied in the adult rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. This protein is synthesized at high levels in neuronal somata in immature and regenerating neurons, but after establishment of mature synaptic relations its synthesis generally declines sharply, thus providing a marker denoting propensity for exhibiting synaptic plasticity. Detailed examination of the distribution of mRNA for GAP-43 in rat hippocampus is selectively and robustly expressed in the pyramidal neurons of field CA3 and, to a lesser extent, the polymorph neurons of the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Additional hippocampal regions of moderate expression include the tenia tecta and the subicular and entorhinal fields, but CA1 and CA2 are strikingly lower in signal. The significance of this pattern of localization is considered in the context of the phosphorylation of GAP-43 and its role in influencing synaptic events underlying the establishment and maintenance of long-term potentiation and plasticity in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Brain damage after global forebrain ischemia is worsened by prior hyperglycemia and ameliorated by antecedent hypoglycemia. To assess whether GLUT3, the neuron specific glucose transporter and its mRNA, are affected by cerebral ischemia, we investigated the hippocampal pattern of GLUT3 immunoreactivity and GLUT3 gene expression 1, 4 and 7 days after global forebrain ischemia in a rat 2-vessel occlusion model. We used a newly generated, specific, C-terminally directed polyclonal antiserum against GLUT3 to stain coronal frozen sections. Thionin staining and the microglial marker, OX42, indicated the extent of ischemic damage in hippocampus and correlated with GLUT3 loss. One day after ischemia, no significant change in hippocampal GLUT3 immunoreactivity was observed; by 4 days however, there was consistent and pronounced loss; and at 7 days the loss of GLUT3 staining was maximal. The greatest loss of GLUT3 staining was in the CA1 region, especially the strata oriens and radiatum of Ammon's horn. By contrast, GLUT3 staining was undiminished in the stratum lacunosum moleculare, in the mossy fibers of the lateral aspect of CA3 and in all but the inner-most portion of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, immediately adjacent to the granule cells. GLUT3 mRNA levels were not significantly altered at 24 hours and significantly declined at 4 and 7 days after ischemia in the CA1 pyramidal layer. These data are consistent with the pattern of neuronal loss and microglial activation in hippocampus. Loss of GLUT3 may affect the availability of glucose, and possibly the viability of ischemically damaged neurons.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis were used to characterize the mRNA expression of alpha-tubulin, a neuroprotein crucial for neuronal structural and functional restoration, in comparison to that of the stress inducible heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70), in the same gerbil brain following 10 min of forebrain ischemia. The HSP-70 expression was noted in the dentate granule layer 1 h postischemia (PI) and became prominent in all pyramidal cell fields of the hippocampus in addition to the dentate layer at 6 h PI. The induction of HSP-70 persisted in CA1 and CA2 regions and partly in dentate gyrus for up to the 1 day PI period examined. There was no significant HSP-70 expression in any of the regions of the nonischemic or 15 min PI brain. alpha-Tubulin, on the other hand, was expressed in all pyramidal fields of the hippocampus as well as dentate gyrus in nonischemic controls. A decline was noted in the CA1 region 1 h PI onward and was maximal at 6 h PI. Its expression, however, increased at 24 h PI (significant only in comparison to 15 min and 6 h PI but not to control) when it became rather strong in the dentate gyrus. Thus, the temporal pattern of expression of alpha-tubulin sharply contrasted with that of HSP-70 in the PI brain as it declined in the vulnerable CA1 region during the 1st 24 h PI, i.e., the period when HSP-70 was induced and its expression was lowest in the 6 h group when HSP-70 peaked. It was maximum in the dentate gyrus at 24 h PI when HSP-70 was marginally detectable in that region. These studies indicate that in early recirculation period following prolonged ischemia, HSP-70 mRNA is expressed in both vulnerable regions as well as in regions of the brain that are destined to survive while alpha-tubulin is diminished in vulnerable regions. These data suggest a positive correlation between the loss of alpha-tubulin mRNA and delayed neuronal necrosis that follows in the vulnerable CA1 region.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Axon-associated cell adhesion molecules (AxCAMs) play crucial roles in the formation, maintenance, and plasticity of functional neuronal networks. We report here a molecular cloning of a novel AxCAM, BIG-2. BIG-2 is a member of TAG-1/F3 subgroup of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, with six Ig-like domains, four fibronectin type III-like repeats, and a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchoring domain. Recombinant BIG-2 protein had a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity when used as a substrate for neurons in vitro. To survey the spatial expression pattern of BIG-2 in comparison with other TAG-1/F3 subgroup members, an in situ hybridization analysis was performed in adult and developing rat brain sections with riboprobes specific for BIG-2, BIG-1, TAG-1, and F3. The four AxCAM transcripts displayed cell type-specific expression patterns with overlapping and distinct profiles. In adult hippocampus, for example, we observed BIG-1 mRNA specifically in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, BIG-2 mRNA highly in the CA1 pyramidal cells, TAG-1 mRNA predominantly in the CA3 pyramidal cells, and F3 mRNA in neurons in all of these fields.

       "  'Abstract': \"The GTP binding protein, Gs, activates adenyl cyclase in direct response to stimulation of several neurotransmitter receptors. In situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with a 35S-labelled oligonucleotide has been used to detect the mRNA encoding the alpha subunit of Gs (Gs alpha) in human hippocampus, temporal and visual cortices and cerebellum, and its level has been compared between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control brains. A marked regional increase was found in the hippocampus of AD cases. Analysis of levels of Gs alpha mRNA in individual constituent pyramidal cells confirmed this increase (3 to 4-fold in densitometric units) in hippocampal fields CA1, CA3 and CA4, as well as in temporal cortex. Levels of Gs alpha mRNA were also determined relative to total poly(A)+ mRNA in the same cell populations in each case. Gene-specific elevation of Gs alpha mRNA was thereby confirmed in hippocampal fields, and also in temporal cortex. No changes were seen in visual cortex. The increase in Gs alpha mRNA may represent a response by AD neurons in affected areas to receptor alterations, or to an abnormality in receptor-G protein coupling. Alternatively, altered G protein gene expression might be a pathogenic event underlying changes in linked receptor populations.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Extracellular serine protease neuropsin (NP) is expressed in the forebrain limbic area of adult brain and is implicated in synaptic plasticity. We screened for endogenous NP inhibitors with recombinant NP (r-NP) from extracts of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex in adult mouse brain. Two SDS-stable complexes were detected, and after their purification, peptide sequences were determined by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry, revealing that target molecules were serine proteinase inhibitor-3 (SPI3) and murinoglobulin I (MUG I). The addition of the recombinant SPI3 to r-NP resulted in an SDS-stable complex, and the complex formation followed bimolecular kinetics with an association rate constant of 3.4 +/- 0.22 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), showing that SPI3 was a slow, tight binding inhibitor of NP. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that SPI3 mRNA was expressed in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1-CA3 subfields, as was NP mRNA. Alternatively, the addition of purified plasma MUG I to r-NP resulted in an SDS-stable complex, and MUG I inhibited degradation of fibronectin by r-NP to 24% at a r-NP/MUG I molar ratio of 1:2. Immunofluorescence histochemistry showed that MUG I localized in the hippocampal neurons. These findings indicate that SPI3 and MUG I serve to inactivate NP and control the level of NP in adult brain, respectively.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The technique of in situ hybridization with tritiated RNA probes was used to study the expression of the 68 kDa neurofilament (NF68) gene and the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) gene in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for these proteins was localized and quantified in single cells of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 4 pairs of AD and Huntington's disease (HD) brains from patients matched for age at death and autopsy interval. The cerebellar cortex and hippocampal CA1 and CA2 regions were compared in these two groups of subjects, since in AD the CA2 region of the hippocampus and the cerebellum have been found to be relatively unaffected by the Alzheimer process in comparison to the hippocampal CA1 region. The amount of NF68 mRNA was reduced by approximately 50% in pyramidal cells of both the CA1 and CA2 of AD hippocampus (P less than 0.001), and by 15% in the Purkinje cells of AD cerebellum (P less than 0.05) relative to that of the HD individuals. SOD-1 mRNA was reduced by about 22% in the CA1 of AD brains (P less than 0.001) with no corresponding reduction in the CA2, and by only 5% in the AD cerebellum (P greater than 0.5). The paired design of the study suggests that these results are not simply attributable to the effects of autopsy interval or the agonal process in each patient's death.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Induction of messenger RNA encoding the 70-kDa heat shock or stress protein, hsp70, and the product of the proto-oncogene c-fos was evaluated in gerbil hippocampus by in situ hybridization at various recirculation intervals after 5 minutes of ischemia. Striking increases in c-fos RNA were observed in dentate granule cells within 15 minutes of recirculation and remained evident through 1 hour, returning to undetectable control levels by 3 hours. Modest c-fos hybridization was seen in CA1 and CA3 neurons during the same time course. These results are consistent with the rapid and transient stimulation-induced c-fos expression observed in many experimental systems. Hsp70 expression showed a longer time course, being strongly induced in all major hippocampal neuron populations within 3 hours and persisting for approximately 12 hours in dentate granule cells and through 24 hours in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Notably, the most prolonged expression of hsp70 RNA was observed in vulnerable CA1 neurons that minimally accumulate the immunoreactive protein, with hybridization detected essentially until the death of this cell population at 3-4 days. These studies demonstrate an overlapping distribution of hsp70 and c-fos expression in gerbil hippocampus after ischemia, although there are differences in time course and in the relative induction observed in different neuron populations. The transient increase in c-fos hybridization in dentate granule cells is identical to that seen in various seizure paradigms and provides further support for activation of hippocampal circuitry after ischemia. The prolonged time course of hsp70 messenger RNA expression in vulnerable CA1 neurons may provide a molecular correlate of proposed excitotoxic mechanisms mediating delayed neuronal death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cerebral ischaemia results in significant brain damage, but the molecular mechanisms associated with ischaemia-induced brain injury are not well defined. We have adopted an improved differential-display method to search for new ischaemia-related genes. Among the different cDNAs isolated following transient forebrain ischaemia in rat, PH3.3 was selected for further studies. The search for homologies revealed that it is the rat homologue to human zinc finger motif 1 (ZFM1), also called mammalian splicing factor 1 (SF1). With Northern blot, PH3.3 hybridized with three mRNA species of 2.3, 2.9 and 3.6 kb, significantly increased at 6 h and 5 days after the ischaemic insult. These findings were extended also to another animal model. In situ hybridization in ischaemic gerbils showed that PH3.3 mRNA was induced in the dentate gyrus as early as 4 h post-ischaemia. Expression peaked at 2 days in the whole hippocampus and cortex, and then progressively decreased towards sham levels. By day 4, expression had disappeared almost entirely from the cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, concomitant with the degeneration of pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, ZFM1/SF1 has been recently identified as activated following p53-induced apoptosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that p53 may play two roles in the post-ischaemic brain. The primary role of p53 is to activate DNA repair processes, but if repair fails, apoptosis will be initiated. Thus, ZFM1/SF1 may represent a relevant link between p53 and the neuroprotective/neurodegenerative processes which follow cerebral ischaemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using in situ hybridization techniques, the expression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was measured within the hippocampal formation after bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX). After 24 hr ADX, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was significantly increased in all hippocampal subfields in ADX animals relative to sham-operated controls (SHAM). The magnitude of the increase was most pronounced within CA2 (127%) and CA3/4 (94%)-subfields of dorsal hippocampus, intermediate in the dentate gyrus (73%), and least within CA1 (60%). Administration of exogenous corticosterone (CORT) at the time of ADX maintained the level of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression within the range of SHAM animals. In vitro receptor autoradiographic analysis of 5-HT1A receptors in adjacent sections from the same animals indicated a simultaneous increase in 5-HT1A binding throughout the hippocampus in response to ADX. 5-HT1A binding increased to a similar extent (approximately 30%) in CA subfields and dentate gyrus but remained within SHAM levels in CORT-replaced animals. 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels were also increased in hippocampal subregions of 1 week ADX animals relative to SHAM animals. Within both CA1 and CA2 subfields, the increments were approximately double those observed after 1 d ADX. 5-HT1A receptor binding was increased in every hippocampal subfield to a similar extent as that observed after 1 d ADX. Increases in both 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression and 5-HT1A receptor binding were preventable by administration of exogenous CORT at the time of ADX. Hippocampal 5-HT1C receptor mRNA and D1 receptor mRNA expression were not significantly altered by either acute or chronic ADX treatment. These data indicate that adrenal steroids may selectively regulate hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors at the level of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Kindling induces the long-lasting expression of a novel population of NMDA receptors in hippocampal region CA3.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Kindling refers to a phenomenon in which repeated application of initially subconvulsive electrical stimulations produces limbic and clonic motor seizures of progressively increasing severity. Once established, the increased excitability is lifelong. Enhanced function of synapses using the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor could contribute to the expression of the increased excitability. We previously found that CA3 pyramidal cells of hippocampus of kindled animals exhibit a selective and long-lasting (1 month) increased sensitivity to NMDA-evoked depolarization. The goal of this study was to develop a molecular explanation of the enhanced sensitivity to NMDA. We used radioligand binding studies of membranes isolated from microdissected regions of hippocampus including fascia dentata, CA3, and CA1. We also used quantitative in situ hybridization with subtype-specific riboprobes or oligonucleotides to determine whether increased expression of one or more of the genes encoding NMDA receptors was present in hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells of kindled animals. When studied 28 d after the last evoked seizure, we found that kindling induced a 2.8-fold increase in the number of binding sites for the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist 3-[(+/-)-2-(carboxypiperazine-4-yl)][1,2-3H-]propyl-1-phosphonic acid (3H-CPP). This increase was confined to region CA3 within the hippocampus. Similar, though much smaller, changes were detected 24 hr after the last evoked seizure. Surprisingly, no changes in the binding of another competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-3H-piperidinecarboxylate (3H-CGS-19755), were detected at either time point in any hippocampal region. Transcript levels of the NMDA receptor genes NMDAR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D and a glutamate-binding protein (GBP) were not altered by kindling. These findings demonstrate that kindling induces the expression of an NMDA receptor that is novel in that it is recognized by 3H-CPP but not by 3H-CGS-19755. The molecular basis of this novel NMDA receptor is not determined by differential expression of mRNA transcripts of known NMDA receptor genes. The direction, time course, and location of the kindling-induced increase in 3H-CPP binding suggest that this novel receptor may underlie the increased sensitivity of CA3 neurons to NMDA observed in kindled animals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) and F1/GAP-43 (B-50/neuromodulin) are both major specific substrates for protein kinase C (PKC) and appear to play an important role in the regulation of neuroplastic events during development and in the adult brain. Since PKC isozymes are differentially expressed in brain and the expression of F1/GAP-43 and MARCKS are differentially regulated by PKC through posttranslational mechanisms, the present study examined the relative distribution of both mRNAs in the adult brain by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. MARCKS hybridization was most pronounced in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex (layer II), medial habenular nucleus, subregions of the amygdala, specific hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampal granule cells, neocortex, and cerebellar cortex, intermediate in the superior colliculus, hippocampal CA1, and certain brainstem nuclei including the locus coeruleus, and low-absent in regions of the caudate-putamen, geniculate, thalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal and hilar neurons. Consistent with previous reports, prominent F1/GAP-43 hybridization was observed in neocortex, medial geniculate, piriform cortex (layer II), substantia nigra pars compacta, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nucleus, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and cerebellar granule cells, intermediate in regions of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, and low-absent in regions of the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, medial habenular nucleus, hippocampal granule cells, and superior colliculus. Overall, F1/GAP-43 was highly expressed in a greater number of regions compared to MARCKS and, in a number of regions, including the hippocampus, habenular complex, ventral tegmentum, geniculate, and certain brain stem nuclei, a striking inverse pattern of expression was observed. These results indicate that MARCKS gene expression, like that of F1/GAP-43, remains elevated in select regions of the adult rat brain which are associated with a high degree of retained plasticity. The potential role of PKC in the regulation of MARCKS and F1/GAP-43 gene expression in brain is assessed.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CamKII) is a ubiquitous brain enzyme implicated in a wide variety of neuronal processes. Understanding CamKII has become increasingly complicated with the recent identification of multiple gene transcripts coding for separate subunits. Previous studies have shown that mRNA for the alpha subunit of CamKII can be increased by reduction of afferent input. In this study we have examined the regulation of alpha CamKII mRNA following increased activity due to seizures. Using in situ hybridization with a cRNA probe against the rat alpha CamKII sequence we found reduced levels of hybridization following limbic seizures induced by lesions of the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Hybridization was most dramatically reduced in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cells of hippocampal region CA1. There were also significant reductions in hybridization in the superficial layers of neocortex and piriform cortex. In each of these region hybridization was decreased in the molecular layers which is consistent with the reported dendritic localization of alpha CamKII mRNA. All changes in mRNA content were transient, with maximal reductions at 24 h following lesion placement and a return to control levels by 96 h. These findings demonstrate the negative regulation of alpha CamKII mRNA by seizure activity and raise the possibility that synthesis of this kinase may be regulated by normal physiological activity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Induction of clusterin in the immature brain following a hypoxic-ischemic injury.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'A unilateral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult in the 21 day old rat has been used to assess the role of clusterin in nerve cell death. Both clusterin mRNA and protein levels were measured at various time points after moderate (15 min) and severe (60 min) HI insult using in situ hybridisation and immunocytochemistry respectively. The severe HI insult lead primarily to necrotic neuronal death and showed very little if any clusterin mRNA and protein induction on the ligated side of the brain. However, following the moderate HI insult there was a dramatic time-dependent accumulation of clusterin protein in neurons of the CA1-CA2 pyramidal cell layers in the hippocampus and cortical layers 3-5, regions undergoing delayed neuronal death. Clusterin mRNA expression, in contrast to neuronal protein accumulation, appeared to be glial in origin (probably astrocytes) with increases in mRNA in and around the hippocampal fissure and only a weak signal over the CA1-CA2 pyramidal cell layer. These results support the hypothesis that the clusterin protein is synthesised in the astrocytes, secreted and then taken up by dying neurons. Clusterin immunoreactivity and in situ DNA end-labelling performed on the same sections revealed that clusterin was accumulating in neurons destined to die by programmed cell death. However the relative time-courses of DNA fragmentation and clusterin immunoreactivity suggest that clusterin production was a result of the selective delayed neuronal death rather than being involved in the biochemical cascade of events that cause it.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Activation of p53 and its target genes p21(WAF1/Cip1) and PAG608/Wig-1 in ischemic preconditioning.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'A brief, 3 min period of global forebrain ischemia in the rat, induced by bilateral common carotid occlusion combined with hypotension, confers resistance to hippocampal pyramidal neurons against a subsequent 10 min ischemia, which is normally lethal to these cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying this ischemic preconditioning, or tolerance, are poorly understood. The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor implicated in neuronal death following various insults, including cerebral ischemia. p53 is activated in response to cellular stress, e.g. hypoxia and DNA damage. Using in situ hybridization, we investigated the hippocampal mRNA expression of p53, and two of its target genes, p21(WAF1/Cip1) and the recently cloned PAG608/Wig-1, in a two-vessel occlusion model of ischemic preconditioning. We also evaluated changes in the protein levels of p53 and PAG608/Wig-1 using immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of all three genes increased in the ischemia sensitive CA1 region both following 3 min (non-lethal) preconditioning and 10 min of (lethal) nonconditioned ischemia. In contrast, after 10 min of ischemia preconditioned by a 3 min ischemic insult 48 h earlier, no upregulation of these genes was detected in the CA1. Following 10 min of nonconditioned ischemia, increased neuronal immunostaining of p53 and PAG608/Wig-1 was observed in the hippocampus, which was less pronounced following 3 min of preconditioning ischemia and 10 min of preconditioned ischemia. Our results demonstrate that activation of p53 and its response genes p21(WAF1/Cip1) and PAG608/Wig-1 occurs in the brain following lethal as well as non-lethal ischemic insults, and that ischemic preconditioning markedly diminishes this activation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Levels of BDNF mRNA and protein were measured in the rat brain using in situ hybridization and a two-site enzyme immunoassay. Under basal conditions, the highest BDNF concentration was found in the dentate gyrus (88 ng/g), while the levels in CA3 (50 ng/g), CA1 (18 ng/g) and parietal cortex (8 ng/g) were markedly lower. Following 10 min of forebrain ischemia, BDNF protein increased transiently in the dentate gyrus (to 124% of control at 6 h after the insult) and CA3 region (to 131% of control, at 1 week after the insult). In CA1 and parietal cortex, BDNF protein decreased to 73-75% of control at 24 h. In contrast, BDNF mRNA expression in dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal layer was transiently elevated to 287 and 293% of control, respectively, at 2 h, whereas no change was detected in CA1 or neocortex. The regional BDNF protein levels shown here correlate at least partly with regional differences in cellular resistance to ischemic damage, which is consistent with the hypothesis of a neuroprotective role of BDNF.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene expression after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion with and without brain damage.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Levels of mRNA for c-fos, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), TrkB, and TrkC were studied using in situ hybridization in the rat brain at different reperfusion times after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Short-term (15 min) MCAO, which does not cause neuronal death, induced elevated BDNF mRNA expression confined to ipsilateral frontal and cingulate cortices outside the ischemic area. With a longer duration of MCAO (2 h), which leads to cortical infarction, the increase was more marked and elevated BDNF mRNA levels were also detected bilaterally in dentate granule cells and CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. Maximum expression was found after 2 h of reperfusion. At 24 h BDNF mRNA expression had returned to control values. In the ischemic core of the parietal cortex only scattered neurons were expressing high levels of BDNF mRNA after 15 min and 2 h of MCAO. Analysis of different BDNF transcripts showed that MCAO induced a marked increase of exon III mRNA but only small increases of exon I and II mRNAs in cortex and hippocampus. In contrast to BDNF mRNA, elevated expression of c-fos mRNA was observed in the entire ipsilateral cerebral cortex, including the ischemic core, after both 15 min and 2 h of MCAO. Two hours of MCAO also induced transient, bilateral increases of NGF and TrkB mRNA levels and a decrease of NT-3 mRNA expression, confined to dentate granule cells. The upregulation of BDNF mRNA expression in cortical neurons after MCAO is probably triggered by glutamate through a spreading depression-like mechanism. The lack of response of the BDNF gene in the ischemic core may be due to suppression of signal transduction or transcription factor synthesis caused by the ischemia. The observed pattern of gene expression after MCAO agrees well with a neuroprotective role of BDNF in cortical neurons. However, elevated levels of NGF and BDNF protein could also increase synaptic efficacy in the postischemic phase, which may promote epileptogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia, we cloned genes expressed after transient forebrain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil by a differential display method. A gerbil homolog of rat zinc transporter, ZnT-1, which transports intracellular Zn2+ out of cells, was isolated. Its expression became detectable exclusively in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region 12 hr after ischemia and reached a maximum from day 1 to day 2 as shown by in situ hybridization. By day 7, expression had disappeared entirely from the cells in the CA1 region, because the neurons had died. No other brain regions exhibited such a significant level of ZnT-1 mRNA expression during this period. Zn2+ was shown to accumulate in CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing ZnT-1 mRNA after the ischemia by using zinquin, a zinc-specific fluorescent dye. When primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to a high dose of Zn2+, ZnT-1 mRNA accumulated. These results suggest that the induction of ZnT-1 mRNA observed in CA1 neurons was caused by an increase in the intracellular Zn2+ concentration. It was reported recently that Zn2+ chelator blocked neuronal death after ischemia and that the influx of Zn2+ might be a key mechanism underlying neuronal death. The induction of ZnT-1 mRNA in CA1 pyramidal neurons fated to die after transient ischemia is of interest to the study of postischemic events and the molecular mechanisms underlying delayed neuronal death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurons in very low density hippocampal cultures that are physiologically identified as either GABAergic inhibitory or glutamatergic excitatory all contain mRNA for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), as detected by single cell mRNA amplification and PCR. However, consistent with the physiology, immunocytochemistry revealed that only a subset of the neurons stain for either GAD protein or GABA. A similar fraction hybridize with RNA probes for GAD65 and GAD67. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in slice preparations, which are traditionally thought to be excitatory, also contain mRNA for GAD65 and GAD67. Hippocampal neurons in culture did not contain mRNA for two other neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase, and choline acetyl transferase. These data suggest that in some neurons, presumably the excitatory neurons, GAD mRNA is selectively regulated at the level of translation. We propose that neurotransmitter phenotype may be posttranscriptionally regulated and neurons may exhibit transient phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental influences.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'A cyclic GMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase gene is highly expressed in the limbic system of the rat brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP serve as second messengers in a variety of neural cells, modulating their metabolic and electrical activity. The cyclic GMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, an enzyme whose hydrolytic activity is allosterically regulated by cyclic GMP in peripheral tissues, could play an important role in the regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels in the brain. To study the presence and distribution of cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase in the rat brain, we cloned a portion of rat liver cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase complementary DNA by polymerase chain reaction, using degenerate phosphodiesterase-specific oligonucleotide primers. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues reveals abundant expression of cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase messenger RNA in the brain. Northern blot analysis of brain subregions shows especially strong expression in hippocampus and cortex, modest expression in the remainder of the forebrain and in the midbrain, and little expression in cerebellum and hindbrain. In situ hybridization studies with cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase riboprobes confirm these northern blot results, and delineate cell groups with high levels of expression. Medial habenular nucleus is intensely labeled, as is hippocampus in the vicinity of pyramidal and granule cell bodies in areas CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus. Other elements of the limbic system also contain cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase messenger RNA, including olfactory and entorhinal cortices, subiculum, and amygdala. Additional cortical regions show more diffuse expression of cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase messenger RNA, as do the basal ganglia. Cerebellum, thalamus, and hypothalamus do not show appreciable specific labeling. These studies demonstrate the presence of cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase messenger RNA in specific regions of the rat brain, and suggest that the cyclic GMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase might modulate neuronal activity by regulating intracellular cyclic AMP levels in response to changes in intracellular cyclic GMP levels.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The influence of chronic electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) or antidepressant drug treatments on expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, trkB, was examined by in situ hybridization and Northern blot. In frontal cortex, acute ECS increased BDNF mRNA approximately twofold, an effect significantly augmented by a prior course of chronic ECS treatment (10 d). In the hippocampus, the influence of chronic ECS varied between the major subfields. In the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, chronic ECS decreased the acute induction of BDNF and trkB mRNA by approximately 50%, but prolonged their expression: levels remained elevated two- to threefold 18 hr later after the last chronic ECS treatment, but returned to control 18 hr after acute ECS. In CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layers, chronic ECS significantly elevated the acute induction of BDNF, and tended to prolong the expression of BDNF and trkB mRNA. A similar effect was observed in layer 2 of the piriform cortex, where chronic ECS significantly increased the acute induction and prolonged the expression of BDNF and trkB mRNA. Chronic (21 d), but not acute (1 d), administration of several different antidepressant drugs, including tranylcypromine, sertraline, desipramine, or mianserin, significantly increased BDNF mRNA and all but mianserin increased trkB mRNA in hippocampus. In contrast, chronic administration of nonantidepressant psychotropic drugs, including morphine, cocaine, or haloperidol, did not increase levels of BDNF mRNA. Furthermore, chronic administration of ECS or antidepressant drugs completely blocked the down-regulation of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus in response to restraint stress. The enhanced induction and prolonged expression of BDNF in response to chronic ECS and antidepressant drug treatments could promote neuronal survival, and protect neurons from the damaging effects of stress.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of thymosin beta4 messenger RNA in normal and kainate-treated rat forebrain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Thymosin beta4 is a major actin-sequestering peptide widely distributed in mammalian tissues, including the nervous system. In the present study, we analyse the expression of thymosin beta4 in normal and kainate-treated rat forebrain. In untreated animals, thymosin beta4 messenger RNA is mainly expressed in neurons of the hippocampal formation, neocortex and amygdaloid complex, as well as in oligodendrocytes. Other high-expressing areas are the tanycytic ependyma of the infundibulum, the substantia nigra pars compacta, and the supraoptic and premammillary nuclei. In rats treated with kainate, an excitotoxin that induces synaptic activation in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, the levels of thymosin beta4 were clearly increased in the hippocampus and neocortex during the first 2-3 h after injection. In the long term, kainate causes neuronal degeneration in the CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus and functionally related structures, provoking a depletion of thymosin beta4 messenger RNA in these areas; however, the levels of this transcript are restored two weeks after kainate injection. Moreover, we have found that, in these degenerating zones, gliosis is accompanied by an elevation of the levels of thymosin beta4 messenger RNA, particularly in the CA1-CA3 region of the hippocampus, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the mammillothalamic tract. The present results demonstrate the existence of relatively high levels of thymosin beta4 messenger RNA in several areas of the rat forebrain, indicating that this peptide plays an important role in the regulation of actin polymerization in these regions of the brain. Moreover, the elevation of this messenger RNA after kainate treatment suggests a function of thymosin beta4 in the production and remodelling of neuronal processes. Finally, our findings provide evidence for a participation of this actin-sequestering molecule in the reactivity of certain types of glial cell that follows kainate lesions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We studied the localizations of alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of soluble guanylate cyclase using in situ hybridization. The beta subunit was widely distributed in most neurons throughout the brain, with different levels of expression. The alpha 1 subunit was also distributed throughout the brain; however, it was located in more limited regions. Both subunits were expressed markedly in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, dorsal and ventral striatum, and several regions in the brainstem. Regions with little or no alpha 1 subunit expression, but with marked expression of the beta 1 subunit included the olfactory bulb except for the glomerular layer, pyramidal cell layer in CA1 and granular cell layer in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and many brainstem nuclei. The above regions expressing both subunits are suggested to contain active soluble guanylate cyclase as a target for nitric oxide, and thus may be involved in cellular signal transduction.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Transient forebrain ischemia induces delayed injury in the substantia nigra reticulata: degeneration of GABA neurons, compensatory expression of GAD mRNA.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In rodents, transient forebrain ischemia causes preferentially neuron death in small and medium size neurons of the striatum and hilar neurons in the hippocampus within 24 h, and CA1 hippocampal neurons within 72 h. The temporal unfolding of pathological processes after longer time intervals between reperfusion and sacrifice now includes delayed degeneration of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr). Animals were exposed to 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia and sacrificed within 7 days, or at least 3 weeks after reperfusion. Histological examination and quantitative morphometrics revealed that the degree of volume loss and neuron loss in the SNr depended on the initial ischemic injury. Initial ischemic injury confined to the caudate nucleus produced volume loss but not neuron loss in the SNr. However, initial ischemic injury that included the caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus produced not only greater volume loss but also neuron loss in the SNr. SNr neuron loss was restricted to the medial dorsal area, occurred in animals that survived at least 3 weeks after perfusion, and did not occur in animals that survived 7 days after perfusion, and was accompanied by increased staining of antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein. The topographic specificity and delayed time course suggest that the mechanism for SNr neuron loss depends on transneuronal events initiated by ischemia but evolving over a longer time period. In situ hybridization with a cDNA probe for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA demonstrated increased GAD signal in the remaining SNr neurons of animals with CN and GP damage compared to animals with CN damage. The significant increase in GAD mRNA may indicate compensation at the level of gene expression for the loss of GABAergic neurons. This rodent model offers new in vivo opportunities to elucidate the requirements for neuronal viability, and phenotypic expression, and suggests that the current notions of windows of opportunity for therapeutic intervention may be expanded from hours to days to weeks.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution of preprovasopressin mRNA in the rat central nervous system.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Vasopressin released in the central nervous system has been shown to be involved both in homeostatic mechanisms (e.g., water balance, thermoregulation, cardiovascular regulation, metabolism, and antinociception) and in higher brain functions (e.g., social recognition and communication, and learning and memory). Many nuclear groups have been proposed to synthesize vasopressin, but available data are conflicting. We have used a sensitive in situ hybridization technique to identify the distribution of the neurons that may be the origin of the vasopressin in the central nervous system of the male Sprague-Dawley rat. Vasopressin mRNA-expressing neurons were most abundant in the hypothalamus (e.g., the paraventricular, supraoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei) but were also seen in the medial amygdaloid nucleus, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and the nucleus of the horizontal diagonal band. Previously unreported vasopressinergic neurons were seen in the entorhinal and piriform cortices, the ventral lateral portion of the parabrachial nucleus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, and the rostral part of the ventral periaqueductal gray matter and the adjacent portion of the mesencephalic reticular nucleus. Vasopressin mRNA expression suggestive of neuronal labeling was seen in the pyramidal layer of the CA1-3 fields and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In addition, vasopressin mRNA expression, probably representing axonal mRNA, was detected over the hypothalamopituitary tract. No or insignificant preprovasopressin mRNA expression was present in the cerebellum, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, or the spinal cord. These findings provide novel information on the distribution of vasopressin neurons that are important for our understanding of how vasopressin acts in the brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The regional expression of inducible 72 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-70), HSP-70 mRNA and the neuropathological outcome of their expression were examined in the rat brain following systemic administration of kainic acid (9 mg/kg), and also after pretreatment with the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg). Five hours after administration of kainic acid alone, dense expression of HSP-70 mRNA was found within the limbic system, mainly in the hippocampus, piriform and entorhinal cortices, amygdaloid complex, thalamic nuclei, subiculum and in other cortical areas in rats that had shown convulsive behaviour. At 24 h, HSP-70 immunoreactivity was seen in most areas previously expressing HSP-70 mRNA, except the piriform and entorhinal cortices and several ventral nuclei of the amygdaloid complex. Histopathological examination at 24 h revealed marked cell loss in these latter regions and less severe histopathological changes in other areas of the limbic system in brains of convulsive rats. No alterations were apparent in non-convulsive rats. The percentage of rats showing convulsive behaviour with kainic acid was reduced from 74 to 4% following pretreatment with MK-801. In addition, MK-801 inhibited the kainic acid-induced expression of HSP-70 mRNA and protein in certain brain regions, notably the cortex, the pyramidal cell layer of CA1, and discrete thalamic nuclei. However, HSP-70 mRNA induction was sustained in the pyramidal cell layer of CA3, the amygdaloid complex and the subiculum, despite the fact that none of these rats convulsed. MK-801 prevented necrosis in all rats examined except the single rat that had shown convulsive behaviour. These results show that early regional expression of inducible HSP-70 mRNA allows the visualization of regions affected by kainic acid and maps regions inhibited by MK-801. In addition, the results identify brain regions putatively involved in the manifestation of limbic convulsions. Furthermore, these data illustrate that the induction of HSP-70 mRNA is not predictive of cell death or survival.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Abstract Corticosteroids exert effects on the hippocampus by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid receptors, but the relative importance of each receptor type in mediating corticosteroid effects is poorly understood. There is an extensive serotoninergic (5-HT) innervation of the hippocampus which interacts with corticosteroid-sensitive cells. We have investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of 5-HT neurons on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in the rat hippocampus using in situ hybridization histochemistry. In controls, glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule cell neurons, and in pyramidal cells of CA1 and CA2, but levels in CAS and CA4 were significantly lower. 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-lesioned animals showed significantly less glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in the dentate gyrus (76% decrease), CA1 (42% decrease) and CA2 (52% decrease; all P<0.05 compared with controls). Mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA was expressed at a similar level in all hippocampal subregions in control rats. 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesioning led to a significant decrease in mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in CA3 (56% fall) and CA4 (45% fall; both P<0.05), but not in the other subregions. Thus the 5-HT innervation regulates hippocampal corticosteroid receptor mRNA expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Trimethyltin (TMT) chloride induces limbic system neurodegeneration, resulting in behavioral alterations including cognitive deficits. Different factors related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) were studied after TMT lesion in Sprague-Dawley rats. The expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) containing 695 amino acids (APP695), APP containing the Kuniz protease inhibitor domain (APP- KPI), presenilin 1 (PS1), c- fos and IL- 1Beta was investigated at different timepoints after a single TMT injection (7 mg/kg i.p.) using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. After the TMT treatment, extensive degeneration of pyramidal neurons was observed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, concomitant with neurodegeneration in the outer layer of the CA1 region and layer II of entorhinal and piriform cortex. The affected regions showed abundant condensed eosinophilic and TUNEL-positive neuronal cells, that were apparent at day 4 after TMT, increasing to day 7 and subsequently disappearing. In the affected regions the levels of APP695 mRNA gradually declined with time after the TMT injection. While there was no apparent alteration in the overall expression of APP- KPI or PS1 mRNA, detailed analysis of the CA3c region showed that the mRNA expression shifted from neurons to glial cells. Three days after TMT, neurons in the piriform cortex, the CA3 region and DG expressed high levels of c-fos mRNA that slowly declined to become normalized when analyzed at day 28. At day 7 after TMT a few distinct IL- 1Beta mRNA expressing glial cells were observed in the CA3c region. Thus, TMT exposure leads to alterations in the expresson of APP, APP- KPI, PS1, c-fos and IL- 1Beta in the limbic system. These findings suggest that TMT lesions, not only share certain key features of AD symptomatology and regional neurodegeneration, but also induce effects on important factors related to the pathophysiology of AD.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Expression of sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization in rat brains submitted to transient forebrain ischemia of 30 min. Induction of this multifunctional protein has been previously observed following diverse types of brain lesions, and an involvement in programmed cell death and synaptic remodelling has been proposed. Ischemia was produced by four-vessel occlusion and followed by various recirculation times ranging from 15 min to 7 days. Up to 6 h after ischemia SGP-2 mRNA did not change in any brain region. After 12 h recirculation, SGP-2 mRNA induction was observed in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1 sector of hippocampus. This induction peaked at 3 days recirculation and then declined. From 24 h recirculation onward, induction also occurred in patchy areas of the cortex, and after 7 days recirculation in the ventral thalamus and in a corona around lesioned parts of the striatum. No induction occurred at any recirculation time in pyramidal neurons of hippocampus or other neuronal populations that are damaged by ischemia. The combination of in situ hybridization with GFAP immunohistochemistry revealed that SGP-2 mRNA was mainly induced in reactive actrocytes. This excludes a direct involvement in ischemic neuronal death and supports the possible participation in the post-lesional reorganization of the tissue.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandin D2, a major prostaglandin in the central nervous system. We analysed the effects of thyroid hormone deprivation on prostaglandin D2 synthase gene expression in the developing rat brain. By in situ hybridization, the strongest prostaglandin D2 synthase mRNA signal was detected in the leptomeninges and choroid plexus. The signal was greatly reduced in the cerebellar interlaminar meninges of hypothyroid rats aged 15 and 25 days. Immunohistochemical studies defined changes in the location of the prostaglandin D2 synthase protein. In control but not in hypothyroid animals, Cajal-Retzius neurons of cortical layer I, and pyramidal cortical plate neurons were intensely stained on postnatal day 5. Conversely, prostaglandin D2 synthase protein levels were higher in neurons of the CA1 and CA3 regions and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of hypothyroid animals on postnatal days 5, 15 and 25, and also in subplate neurons on postnatal days 15 and 25. In agreement with the in situ hybridization and northern blotting data, the major difference was found in the cerebellar interlaminar meninges of hypothyroid animals, where the protein was clearly down-regulated on postnatal days 15 and 25. These results show that hypothyroidism causes both age- and region-specific alterations in the expression and location of the prostaglandin D2 synthase during postnatal brain development, probably reflecting a cell-specific regulatory effect of thyroid hormone on the prostaglandin D2 synthase.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Regionally specific and rapid increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA in the adult rat brain following seizures induced by systemic administration of kainic acid.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization techniques were used to analyse the spatiotemporal pattern of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA elevation associated with kainic acid-induced seizure activity in the rat. Pronounced increases in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels were observed as early as 30 min following the onset of behavioral seizures. The greatest increase (10-fold) occurred in the dentate granule cell layer, while pyramidal layers CA1, CA3, and CA4 exhibited increases of two- to six-fold. Peak elevation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA in CA1 hippocampal region was evident at 4 h in CA3, and in the dentate granule layer at 30 min postseizure. Elevations persisted in the dentate and hilar regions to four days, while the increases in CA1 and CA3 returned to control levels by 16 h following seizure. Significant increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA were also observed in the superficial layers of cortex (II and III) and in the piriform cortex which reached peak elevations by 8 h. No detectable changes were observed in the dorsomedial thalamus. Although histologically defined pyramidal and granule cell layers displayed relatively uniform increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA in response to kainate, a closer examination of the labeling patterns using emulsion autoradiography revealed discrete areas of high grain densities overlapping uniform, moderate hybridization densities in the dentate granule cell layer and CA3, suggesting that the capacity to upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA in these regions may differ among individual neurons. In conclusion, our studies revealed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA induction in response to systemic kainate administration differs in hippocampal and cortical areas, in magnitude, time of onset and duration. The observed temperospatial pattern does not correspond in a simple way to increases in metabolic or electrical activity associated with seizures or neuronal vulnerability coincident with the seizures.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Seizure activity causes a rapid increase in sulfated glycoprotein-2 messenger RNA in the adult but not the neonatal rat brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The present study investigated the changes in sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) messenger RNA at various times following kainic acid-induced seizure onset in adult and neonatal rat brain. Double labelling using immunostaining of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein indicated that SGP-2 expression was rapidly and transiently increased in granule cells of the dentate gyrus up to 8 hours after seizure onset. Thereafter, and up to 7 days following seizure onset, the majority of cells exhibiting increased SGP-2 expression were astrocytes located in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the alveus, as well as in regions adjacent to CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. No increase in SGP-2 mRNA was detected in pyramidal neurons selectively damaged by KA. In addition, increased expression of SGP-2 following KA administration was not observed in neonatal rat hippocampus prior to postnatal day 21. The results argue against a role for SGP-2 in KA-induced neuronal death and demonstrate a surprisingly rapid increase in astroglial gene expression following seizure activity, thus supporting a role for SGP-2 in synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methodologies the localization of neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and two of its receptors, the Y1- and the Y2-receptor (R), has been analysed in various tissues in normal animals and animals subjected to different experimental procedures as well as animals with a genetic and an acquired disease. (1) Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are discussed with special focus on the effect of peripheral nerve injury. In normal DRG neurons NPY cannot be detected, whereas Y1-R mRNA and Y1-R-like immunoreactivity (LI) are strongly expressed. The Y1-Rs decorate the membrane of the cell soma and are not transported peripherally into the axonal branches. Y2-R mRNA levels are low. After axotomy there is a marked increase in NPY, a decrease in Y1-Rs and an increase in Y2-Rs. The Y2-R is transported centrifugally. These findings suggest that NPY-ergic mechanisms participate in the adaptive changes of sensory neurons in response to injury. (2) Using specific antibodies the cellular and subcellular localization of the Y1-R protein have been analysed in cerebral blood vessels. The results demonstrate high concentrations of receptors in smooth muscle cells around pial arterioles with lower numbers in large vessels on the basal surface of the brain. In many regions the receptors 'disappear' after the arterioles have entered the brain tissue. At the ultrastructural level the receptors are found both on the endothelial and peripheral side of the muscle cells as well as laterally, where muscle cells oppose each other. The receptor protein is often associated with small vesicles. No NPY-positive nerve fibers were found around the Y1-R-rich arterioles, but they were only seen around the arteries with low Y1-R levels. The Y1-R-rich arterioles were, however, seen close to numerous NPY-positive fibers originating from central interneurons. These findings raise the possibility that centrally originating NPY can influence cerebral blood flow, possibly by stimulating NPY-Rs on the peripheral side of the muscle cells. However, also blood borne NPY, released under special conditions, such as stress from sympathetic nerves and the adrenal medulla and transported with blood, may stimulate receptors on the endothelial side of the smooth muscle cells. (3) In the arcuate nucleus Y1- and Y2-Rs are found, whereby the Y1-Rs are located in its ventro-medial portion and co-localized with POMC peptides, and the Y2-R in its ventromedial part, partly co-localized with NPY. NPY nerve endings makes synaptic contact with the POMC/Y1-R-positive neurons. In a mouse model for genetic anorexia very high levels of NPY were observed in arcuate neurons as compared to control mice. However, NPY mRNA levels were not different between the two groups. Taken together these findings are in good agreement with the view that NPY in the arcuate nucleus plays an important role in regulating feeding behaviour. (4) After intracerebral prion inoculation in mice an upregulation of NPY mRNA levels was observed in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this effect was seen at a time point just before the first behavioural symptoms were manifested. At approximately the same time there was a dramatic decrease in Y2-R binding in strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, whereas in other regions no changes or much smaller changes were observed. Also, there was only a very slight decrease in Y2-R mRNA levels in CA3 neurons. It thus appears as if the prion disease prevents ligand binding to the Y2-R, perhaps by influencing traffic of receptor proteins, possibly at the level of cell membrane-associated caveolae, which have been implicated in the conversion of normal protein to scrapie protein. It is possible that these changes in NPY-ergic mechanisms may underlie some of the central symptoms associated with the prion disease. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent in vitro studies indicate an involvement of members of the interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) family of proteases in programmed neuronal cell death. Cell death of hippocampal neurons in animal models of cerebral ischemia and epilepsy shows morphological features of apoptosis and can be prevented by administration of protein synthesis inhibitors suggesting that de novo synthesis of components of the cell death program is necessary for neuronal apoptosis. In the present study we demonstrate by in situ hybridization analysis that expression of CPP-32, an ICE-related protease, is significantly upregulated in CA1 hippocampal neurons following global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest and in hippocampal neurons of the CA3/CA4 region after kainate-mediated epilepsy, respectively. Moreover, an increase in CPP-32-like proteolytic activity was detected in hippocampal extracts 24 h after ischemia using the fluorogenic CPP-32 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC. Activation of CPP-32 clearly preceded cell death of hippocampal neurons as assessed by in situ end-labelling of nuclear DNA fragments. These results indicate that CPP-32 protease may be activated at both the transcriptional and post-translational level during neuronal apoptosis and that activation correlates with the selective vulnerability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to ischemic and epileptic insults.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recurrent seizure activity leads to delayed neuronal death as well as to inflammatory responses involving microglia in hippocampal subfields CA1, CA3 and CA4. Since mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases control neuronal apoptosis and trigger generation of inflammatory cytokines, their activation state could determine seizure-related brain damage. PAC1 is a dual specificity protein phosphatase inactivating MAP kinases which we have found to be undetectable in normal brain. Despite this, kainic acid-induced seizure activity lead to rapid (approximately 3 h) but transient appearance of PAC1 mRNA in granule cells of the dentate gyrus as well as in pyramidal CA1 neurons. This pattern changed with time and after 2-3 days PAC1 was induced in dying CA1 and CA3 neurons. At this time PAC1 mRNA was also expressed in white matter microglia as well as in microglia invading the damaged hippocampus. PAC1 may play an important role controlling MAP kinase involvement in both neuronal death and neuro-inflammation following excitotoxic damage.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"In situ hybridization was used to study the neuroanatomical distribution of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression during development in the rat. This study was based on incubation of adjacent sections of brains from 2-, 8-, 12-, 16-day-old and adult (3 months) rats with 35S-labelled cRNA probes. These probes are transcribed from 513 and 500 basepair cDNA fragments with little homology from rat brain MR and rat liver GR respectively. Different patterns of expression were found in the brain of MR and GR during ontogeny. At postnatal day (pnd) 2, a high density of labelled MR mRNA was found in all pyramidal (CA1-4) and granular (dentate gyrus) cell fields of the hippocampal structure, the anterior hippocampus and indusium griseum, and cortex layer II. Modest to high labelling of MR mRNA was observed in the subfornical organ and the anterior hypothalamus. A variety of other telencephalic regions anterior and posterior of bregma exhibited modest to weak intensity of labelled MR mRNA. The diencephalon virtually lacked labelled MR mRNA. At older postnatal ages including the adult age, this regional distribution of radiolabelled MR mRNA did not change. At pnd 2, abundant radiolabelled GR mRNA was found widespread over the tel- and diencephalon, with the highest density observed in cell field CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampus and the parvocellular division of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Modestly labelled GR mRNA was observed in various hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, the lateral septum and the amygdala. At older postnatal ages and in adulthood, the intensity of labelled GR mRNA became progressively stronger in the hippocampus. Moreover, we observed a trend towards a more condensed and narrow band of cell bodies in the hippocampus for both MR and GR mRNA during ontogeny. A semi-quantitative comparison of the intensity of both labelled mRNA's performed at each age revealed a significantly lower expression of GR than MR mRNA in the CA3 cell field at pnd 2. At pnd 8 and 12, the amount of GR mRNA was significantly lower in the dentate gyrus and the CA3, whereas in adulthood, less GR mRNA was measured in all pyramidal and granular cell fields. The present study demonstrates that MR and GR genes are expressed in early postnatal development in a pattern resembling that in adulthood. As is the case in the adult brain, there is more MR than GR mRNA in the hippocampus during ontogeny, especially in the CA3 cell field and the DG.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using a combination of data base searching, polymerase chain reaction, and library screening, we have identified a putative K-Cl cotransporter isoform (KCC2) in rat brain that is specifically localized in neurons. A cDNA of 5566 bases was obtained from overlapping clones and encoded a protein of 1116 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 123.6 kDa. Over its full length, the amino acid sequence of KCC2 is 67% identical to the widely distributed K-Cl cotransporter isoform (KCC1) identified in rat brain and rabbit kidney (Gillen, C., Brill, S., Payne, J.A., and Forbush, B., III(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 16237-16244) but only approximately25% identical to other members of the cation-chloride cotransporter gene family, including \"loop\" diuretic-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransport and thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransport. Based on analysis of the primary structure as well as homology with other cation-chloride cotransporters, we predict 12 transmembrane segments bounded by N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic regions. Four sites for N-linked glycosylation are predicted on an extracellular intermembrane loop between putative transmembrane segments 5 and 6. Northern blot analysis using a KCC2-specific cDNA probe revealed a very highly expressed approximately5.6-kilobase transcript only in brain. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that KCC1 was present in rat primary astrocytes and rat C6 glioma cells but that KCC2 was completely absent from these cells, suggesting KCC2 was not of glial cell origin. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that the KCC2 transcript was expressed at high levels in neurons throughout the central nervous system, including CA1-CA4 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, granular cells and Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, and many groups of neurons throughout the brainstem.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Megencephaly, enlarged brain, is a major sign in several human neurological diseases. The mouse model for megencephaly (mceph/mceph) has an enlarged brain, presumably due to brain cell hypertrophy, and exhibits neurological and motor disturbances with seizure-like activity, as well as disturbances in the insulin-like growth factor system. Here, we report that expression of the neuropeptides cholecystokinin, enkephalin, galanin and neuropeptide Y is dramatically changed in mceph/mceph brains compared to wild type, as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The changes were confined to discrete brain regions and occurred in a parallel fashion for peptides and their transcripts. For cholecystokinin, mceph/mceph brains had region-specific up- and down-regulations in several layers of the hippocampal formation and increased levels in, especially ventral, cortical regions. Enkephalin messenger RNA expression was up-regulated in the dentate gyrus granular layer and in ventral cortices, but down-regulated in the CA1 pyramidal layer. Enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was elevated in mossy fibers of the hippocampus and the ventral cortices. Galanin expression was increased in several layers and interneurons of the hippocampal formation, as well as in ventral cortices. Galanin-like immunoreactivity was reduced in nerve terminals in the forebrain. Neuropeptide Y expression was increased in the hippocampal formation and ventral cortices. Whether the mainly increased peptide levels contribute to the excessive growth of the brain or represent a consequence of this growth and/or of the neurological and motor disturbances remains to be elucidated.',\n",

The Oxtr is found in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the brain and research is focusing on how, for example, activation of the receptor in interneurons can enhance the signal-to-noise of neuronal transmission. It is important to understand which neurons in the mouse dorsal hippocampus might be activated during memory formation.

       "  'Abstract': 'Multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) including CaMKI, II and IV, are thought to regulate a variety of neuronal functions. Unlike CaMKII, which is regulated by autophosphorylation, CaMKI as well as CaMKIV are activated by CaMKK. In this study, we examined the cellular and subcellular localization of CaMKIdelta, a recently identified fourth isoform of CaMKI, in the mature brain. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated wide expression of CaMKIdelta mRNA in the adult mouse brain with prominent expression in the hippocampal pyramidal cells. FLAG-tagged CaMKIdelta was localized at the cytoplasm and neurites without nuclear immunoreactivity in approximately 80% of the transfected primary hippocampal neurons. The stimulation with either KCl depolarization or glutamate triggered the nuclear localization of FLAG-tagged CaMKIdelta by two-fold with a peak at 1 min. In contrast, the catalytically inactive mutants of CaMKIdelta remained cytoplasmic without nuclear translocation during KCl depolarization, indicating the requirement of its activation for the nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we showed that immunoprecipitated CaMKIdelta could phosphorylate cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)alphain vitro and that the over-expression of CaMKIdelta enhanced GAL4-CREB-luciferase activity in PC12 cells stimulated by KCl depolarization. Our present study provides the first evidence for the possible involvement of CaMKIdelta in nuclear functions through its nuclear translocation in response to stimuli that trigger intracellular Ca2+ influx.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Expression of the serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase-1 (sgk-1) gene has been reported to be induced by various stress stimuli such as hyper- or hypo-osmotic stress, UV irradiation, and heat shock stress; however, its association with global ischemia in the brain has not been studied. Using high-density oligonucleotide array analysis, we found that the sgk-1 gene was one of the genes showing alteration of expression in the rat hippocampus during 1-4 h of reperfusion after 10 min of transient global cerebral ischemia. Using TaqMan RT-PCR analysis, we confirmed an increased level of sgk-1 gene expression with statistical significance in the rat hippocampus at 2 h of reperfusion after 10 min of transient global cerebral ischemia. Using in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis, the increased level of sgk-1 gene expression was found to localize in pyramidal cells of CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus after 2 h of reperfusion. These results provide an insight into the alterations of sgk-1 gene expression in the rat hippocampus after transient global cerebral ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Kainate-induced status epilepticus alters glutamate and GABAA receptor gene expression in adult rat hippocampus: an in situ hybridization study.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In adult rats, intraperitoneal administration of kainic acid, a glutamic acid analog and potent neurotoxin, induces persistent seizure activity that results in electrographic alterations and neuropathology that closely resemble human temporal lobe epilepsy. We used in situ hybridization to identify regions of altered glutamate and GABAA receptor gene expression following kainate-induced status epilepticus. In the CA3/CA4 area, the hippocampal region most vulnerable to neurodegeneration after kainate acid treatment, expression of GluR2 (the AMPA/kainate receptor subunit that limits Ca2+ permeability) and GluR3 was decreased markedly at 12 and 24 hr, times preceding neurodegeneration. These findings raise the possibility that increased formation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA/kainate receptors in the CA3/CA4 area may enhance glutamate pathogenicity. Expression of the GABAA alpha 1, subunit was also reduced, indicating a possible decrease in inhibitory transmission, which would also enhance excitotoxicity. GluR1 and NR1 expression was not significantly changed. In the dentate gyrus, a region resistant to neurodegeneration, concomitant increases in GluR2 and GluR3 expression were observed; GluR1, NR1, and GABAA alpha 1 mRNAs were not detectably altered. Analysis of emulsion-dipped sections revealed that the changes in GluR2, GluR3, and GABAA alpha 1 expression represented changes in mRNA content per neuron and were specific to pyramidal cells of the CA3/CA4 area and to granule cells of the dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that kainate seizures modify hippocampal glutamate and GABAA receptor expression in a cell-specific manner. Timing of the changes in glutamate and GABAA receptor mRNAs indicates that these changes may play a causal role in hippocampal neuronal cell loss following kainate-induced seizures.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Dendritic localization of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA/kainate channels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Although it is well established that cortical and hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons generally have large numbers of Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate channels (Ca-A/K channels), their presence on pyramidal neurons is controversial. Ca2+ permeability of AMPA channels is regulated by expression of a particular glutamate receptor subunit (GluR2), which confers Ca2+ impermeability to heteromeric channels. Most electrophysiology studies, as well as in situ hybridization and immunolabeling studies demonstrating expression of GluR2 mRNA or peptide in pyramidal neurons, have provided evidence against the presence of Ca-A/K channels on pyramidal neurons. However, observations that pyramidal neurons often appear to be labeled by kainate-stimulated Co2+ influx (Co2+(+) cells), a histochemical stain that identifies cells possessing Ca-A/K channels, suggests that they may have these channels. The present study futher examines cellular and subcellular distribution of Ca-A/K channels on hippocampal pyramidal neurons in slice as well as in culture. To this end, techniques of kainate-stimulated Co2+ influx labeling, supplemented by AMPA receptor subunit immunocytochemistry and fluorescent imaging of kainate-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) rises are employed. Co2+ labeling is often seen in pyramidal neuronal dendrites in both slice and in culture. In addition, although GluR1 and 4 staining in these neurons is often seen in the soma and dendrites, GluR2 label, when evident, is generally more restricted to the soma. Finally, measurement of kainate-stimulated [Ca2+]i rises in cultured neurons, assessed by using low affinity Ca2+ indicators in the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel blockade, often shows dendritic rises to precede those in the somata. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that Ca-A/K channels are present in dendritic domains of many pyramidal neurons, and may help to provide resolution of the apparently conflicting data regarding their distribution.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) is one of two principal receptors mediating the behavioral effects of vasopressin (Avp) in the brain. Avpr1b has recently been shown to strongly influence social forms of aggression in mice and hamsters. This receptor appears to play a role in social recognition and motivation as well as in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Most of these studies have been performed in knockout mice, a species in which the localization of the Avpr1b has not been described, thus precluding correlations with the behaviors. We performed in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with specific probes and found especially prominent expression within the CA2 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, with much lower expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and amygdala. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed expression in those as well other areas in which the ISHH was not sensitive enough to detect labeled cells (e.g. piriform cortex, septum, caudate-putamen and lower brainstem areas). Mouse Avpr1b transcript levels were not altered in the CA2 field by restraint stress or adrenalectomy. Finally, ISHH and RT-PCR showed expression of the Avpr1b gene in the rat and human hippocampi as well. We suggest that the CA2 field may form or retrieve associations (memories) between olfactory cues and social encounters.',\n",

Basic fibroblast growth factor gene expression was investigated by means of RNA hybridization, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical analysis, and histological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin staining. A 3.7-kb bFGF messenger (m)RNA was detected in the rat hippocampus in both control and injured rats. In the mild injury group its expression was increased at 12 hours after injury and peaked on the 3rd day. Neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal CA2 and CA3 sectors was maximum on that day. In the severe injury group, the expression of the bFGF gene was the same as that in the mild injury group at corresponding times, but the number of surviving neurons in the CA2 and CA3 sectors was much lower than in the mild injury group. In situ hybridization showed that the main cells that expressed bFGF mRNA were pyramidal and granulocytic neurons in all three experimental groups. The number of neurons expressing bFGF mRNA in the severe injury group was less than that in the mild injury group, but the intensity of expression was greater.

In severe injury there is a reduced expression of bFGF. The reason for this appears to be that more of the cells that have the potential to express bFGF have died, reducing the ability to express the bFGF gene. Conversely, it is possible that there may be an intrinsic insufficiency of expression of the gene, compatible with the known vulnerability of the hippocampus to many pathological conditions.

       "  'Abstract': 'Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is an important mitogen and neurotrophic factor that binds and signals through the high-affinity receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, only a limited amount of information is available concerning the molecular forms and anatomical distribution of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in the normal human brain. We found multiple bFGF and FGFR1 mRNA transcripts which vary in expression pattern across human brain regions. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we localized bFGF and FGFR1 mRNA and protein to cells in the normal adult human hippocampus and caudal entorhinal cortex (ERC). The majority of pyramidal neurons contained FGFR1 mRNA and protein in the mesial temporal lobe, with neurons in the CA2/CA3 region demonstrating the highest levels of FGFR1 mRNA. In contrast to FGFR1, bFGF mRNA expression was detected at very low levels in a small fraction of the neurons in the human hippocampus and caudal ERC. While bFGF mRNA may be expressed at low levels in neurons, bFGF-immunopositive cells with astrocytic features were detected throughout the mesial temporal lobe in rats, monkeys and humans. bFGF immunoreactive processes are found traversing the dentate gyrus, and bFGF immunoreactive cells are found in the neurogenic subgranular zone in all three mammalian species studied. The anatomical distribution of these two FGF family members suggests that bFGF is endogenously positioned to be involved in ongoing neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, and that FGF trophic signaling to differentiated neurons could involve the release of astrocytic bFGF acting on neuronal FGFR1 in the normal adult human hippocampus.',\n",

Plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases (PMCAs) are responsible for setting intracellular Ca2+ levels and may be involved in the dynamic processing of Ca2+ loads in normal and pathological conditions. In situ hybridization was employed to determine the expression pattern of the four human PMCA isoforms in the human hippocampus. PMCA1 and 3 mRNAs were weakly expressed throughout the hippocampal formation, whereas PMCA2 and 4 mRNA expression showed distinct regional differences, with increased levels in CA2 and the dentate gyrus. Differential expression of PMCA isoforms may reflect cellular differences in Ca(2+)-handling properties and provide a partial explanation for the differential susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to Ca(2+)-mediated cell death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+(o))-sensing receptor (CaR) plays a key role in maintaining near constancy of Ca2+(o) in mammals through its presence in parathyroid gland and kidney. The CaR is also present in brain, and although its role(s) in the brain is not known, it is possible that small changes in Ca2+(o) modify essential physiological and pathological processes, since calcium is crucial for numerous neuronal functions. Northern analysis has revealed that the CaR mRNA is present in hippocampus and several other regions of the brain. The hippocampus is an important site for learning and memory, but the relevance of the CaR to these processes is unknown. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative in vitro analog of memory, can only be induced after 7-10 days postnatally in rat hippocampus. Therefore, in the present study we determined the time course for the developmental expression of the CaR in rat hippocampus to assess its relationship to the development of other important hippocampal functions, such as the capacity for induction of LTP. Northern and Western analyses showed that CaR mRNA and protein were expressed at low levels at 5 days postnatally but then increased markedly at 10 days. A high level of receptor expression, due primarily to an increase in a 7.5 kb transcript, persisted until 30 days, when it gradually decreased by 3-fold to reach the adult level of expression. In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry revealed CaR mRNA and protein in pyramidal cells of all the layers of hippocampus and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. The results show that CaR expression rises at a time when LTP can first be induced in hippocampus and persists at high levels during the time when brain development is proceeding most rapidly. Further studies are needed to determine the role of the CaR in the development of important aspects of the function of hippocampus and other regions of brain, including LTP.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Oligonucleotide DNA probes were used to determine the distribution of mRNAs encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaM-KII) in developing rat brain. The regional and temporal distribution of these mRNAs closely paralleled the distribution and developmental appearance previously reported for their respective protein subunits. alpha-Subunit mRNA was barely detectable in sagittal sections at 4 d postnatal but increased as much as 10-fold in frontal cortex by day 16. beta-Subunit mRNA, on the other hand, was readily detected at 4 d postnatal and changed only slightly during development. Telencephalic structures exhibited the highest levels of CaM-KII mRNA and the brain stem displayed the least. alpha-Subunit mRNA was not observed in cerebellar granule cells and was barely detectable in Purkinje cells, while the beta-mRNA was easily detected in both neuronal types. mRNAs for both alpha- and beta-subunits were present in many neuronal cell bodies; however, only the alpha-subunit mRNA was localized to molecular layers of the hippocampus and lamina I of the frontal cortex. These layers of neuropil are relatively cell sparse and contain extensive dendritic arborizations and synaptic contacts. Since polyribosomes have been observed near hippocampal dendritic spines, the localization of alpha-subunit mRNA to dendrites of pyramidal and dentate granule cells suggests that this subunit is synthesized in situ at postsynaptic sites. The co-localization of translational machinery and high concentrations of CaM-KII in postsynaptic elements suggests an important relationship between alpha-subunit synthesis and the maintenance and plasticity of postsynaptic structures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of synapses during brain development. In the rodent, changes in subunit expression and assembly of the heteromeric receptor complex accompany these maturational processes. However, little is known about N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit expression during human brain development. We used in situ hybridization to examine the distribution and relative abundance of NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunit messenger ribonucleic acids in the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortex of 34 human subjects at five stages of life (neonate, infant, adolescent, young adult and adult). At all ages, the three messenger ribonucleic acids were expressed in all subfields, predominantly by pyramidal neurons, granule cells and polymorphic hilar cells. However, their abundance varied across ontogeny. Levels of NR1 messenger ribonucleic acid in CA4, CA3 and CA2 subfields were significantly lower in the neonate than all other age groups. In the dentate gyrus, subiculum and parahippocampal gyrus, NR2B messenger ribonucleic acid levels were higher in the neonate than in older age groups. NR2A messenger ribonucleic acid levels remained constant, leading to an age-related increase in NR2A/2B transcript ratio. We conclude that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit messenger ribonucleic acids are differentially expressed during postnatal development of the human hippocampus, with a pattern similar but not identical to that seen in the rodent. Changes in subunit composition may thus contribute to maturational differences in human hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function, and to their role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Changes in the subunit stoichiometry of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) alters its channel properties, and may enhance or reduce neuronal excitability in temporal lobe epilepsy patients. This study determined whether hippocampal NMDA receptor subunit mRNA levels were increased or decreased in temporal lobe epilepsy patients compared with nonseizure autopsy cases. Hippocampal sclerosis (HS; n = 16), non-HS (n = 10), and autopsy hippocampi (n = 9) were studied for NMDAR1 (NR1) and NR2A-D mRNA levels by using semiquantitative in situ hybridization techniques, along with neuron densities. Compared with autopsy hippocampi, non-HS and HS patients showed increased NR2A and NR2B hybridization densities per dentate granule cell. Furthermore, non-HS hippocampi showed increased NR1 and NR2B mRNA levels per CA2/3 pyramidal neuron compared with autopsy cases. HS patients, by contrast, showed decreased NR2A hybridization densities per CA2/3 pyramidal neuron compared with non-HS and autopsy cases. These findings indicate that chronic temporal lobe seizures are associated with differential changes in hippocampal NR1 and NR2A-D hybridization densities that vary by subfield and clinical-pathological category. In temporal lobe epilepsy patients, these findings support the hypothesis that in dentate granule cells NMDA receptors are increased, and excitatory postsynaptic potentials should be strongly NMDA mediated compared with nonseizure autopsies. HS patients, by comparison, showed decreased pyramidal neuron NR2A mRNA levels, and this suggests that NMDA-mediated pyramidal neuron responses should be reduced in HS patients compared with non-HS cases.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cyclic nucleotides are major intracellular mediators in the signal transduction events in synaptic neurotransmission of the CNS. Intracellular Ca2+ is known to regulate adenylyl cyclase (AC) in a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner, and guanylyl cyclase (GC), in an indirect manner through CaM-sensitive nitric oxide synthase. To ascertain the physiological significance of cyclic nucleotide second messenger systems, we have localized the mRNAs encoding AC, GC, and CaM in the rat brain by in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled RNA probes. The AC mRNA is widely distributed throughout the brain; strong hybridization signal was observed in the granular layers of the cerebellum, in the pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampus, and in the olfactory system. These AC mRNA localizations are compatible with the distribution of Ca2+/CaM-sensitive AC activities. In contrast to AC mRNA distribution, GC mRNA has a more limited distribution. Significant signals were observed in the striatum, in the pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampus, in the olfactory system, in the inferior and superior colliculus, in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, in the locus coeruleus, and in many pyramidal cells in the layers II-III and V of the cerebral cortex, and mainly, in the occipital cortex. In some discrete brain regions, a close correlation was found between enzyme activity and mRNA hybridization signal of GC. The distinct distribution of AC and GC mRNAs suggests that different cyclic nucleotide second messenger systems have specialized functions. On the other hand, CaM mRNA was colocalized with the AC and GC mRNA, but its distribution was more abundant and specific for neuronal cells, since there was little hybridization signal with CaM probe in neuronal fiber regions such as the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure. The high expression of CaM mRNA in neuronal cells is in agreement with its biochemical role in the regulation of various enzymes. Results of the present study should help in analyzing the role of cyclic nucleotides and CaM in physiological and pathological situations in the CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Significant body of evidence indicates an important role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampal synaptic plasticity; however, the exact mechanisms how the BDNF signal is converted to plastic changes during memory processes are under an intense investigation. To specifically address the role of the trkB receptor, we have previously generated transgenic mice overexpressing the full-length trkB receptor and observed a continuous activation of the trkB.TK+ receptor, improved learning and memory but an attenuated LTP in these mice. In this study, we describe the trkB.TK+ mRNA and protein distribution in the transgenic mice, showing the most prominent increase in the full-length trkB expression in the cortical layer V pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In addition, we have analyzed the mRNA expression patterns of a group of genes associated with both plastic changes in the nervous system and BDNF signaling. Regulated expression of immediate early genes c-fos, fra-2 and junB was observed in the transgenic mice. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of alpha-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alpha-CaMKII) was reduced in both the hippocampus and parietal cortex, whereas growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) mRNA expressions were induced in the corresponding regions. Conversely, the mRNA expression of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was not altered in the trkB.TK+mice. Finally, the density of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing cells was increased in the trkB.TK+ mice dentate hilus. Altogether, these results demonstrate in vivo that the increased trkB.TK+ signaling regulates several important plasticity-related genes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Quantitative in situ hybridization was used to determine whether the prevalence or topographical distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or tyrosine receptor kinase (trk) B mRNA is altered in the hippocampal formation following lesions of excitatory afferents from the entorhinal cortex which provides an external source of innervation for the hippocampal formation. BDNF mRNA levels were not altered in the hippocampal formation up to 10 days following entorhinal cortex lesions (ECLs). The levels of mRNA coding for all known forms of trkB receptors also remained unchanged. The prevalence of the synaptic plasticity marker SNAP-25 mRNA was increased in the CA2 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers and the dentate gyrus by 6 days following ECLs and remained elevated at 10 days following ECLs. Our findings indicate that hippocampal neuron sprouting which occurs in response to ECLs is not the result of changes in the expression of the BDNF or trkB mRNA.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study determined whether hippocampal kainate (KA) receptor mRNA levels were increased or decreased in temporal lobe epilepsy patients compared with nonseizure autopsies. Hippocampal sclerosis (HS; n = 17), nonsclerosis (non-HS; n = 11), and autopsy hippocampi (n = 9) were studied for KA1-2 and GluR5-7 mRNA levels using semiquantitative in situ hybridization techniques, along with neuron densities. Compared with autopsy hippocampi, HS and non-HS cases showed decreased GluR5 and GluR6 hybridization densities per CA2 and/or CA3 pyramid. Furthermore, HS patients demonstrated increased KA2 and GluR5 hybridization densities per granule cell compared with autopsy hippocampi. These findings indicate that chronic temporal lobe seizures were associated with differential changes in hippocampal KA1-2 and GluR5-7 hybridization densities that vary by subfield and pathology group. In temporal lobe epilepsy patients, these results support the hypothesis that pyramidal cell GluR5 and GluR6 mRNA levels are decreased as a consequence of seizures, and in HS patients granule cell KA2 and GluR5 mRNA levels are increased in association with aberrant fascia dentata mossy fiber sprouting and/or hippocampal neuronal loss.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Of the three genes encoding the Ca2+ transport ATPases of the endoplasmic reticulum, the SERCA2 gene is the major isoform expressed in the mammalian brain. The SERCA2 transcript is alternatively processed generating two protein isoforms: SERCA2a which is expressed in cardiac and slow-skeletal muscle, and SERCA2b, the house-keeping isoform which is ubiquitously expressed. We have studied the expression of SERCA2 in the cat brain, and at a less refined level also in the rat brain, using antibodies specific for either SERCA2a or SERCA2b. The SERCA2a staining was very restricted. The SERCA2a antibody clearly labeled the cell body of the Purkinje neurons and weakly stained the giant cells of the gigantocellular reticular nuclei. In contrast, the SERCA2b isoform was found in most regions of the brain. It appeared to be largely confined to neuronal cells. Neuroglial cells were negative. The antibody stained the cell body. In heavily labeled cells such as the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and of the cerebral cortex, it also stained the proximal portion of the dendrites. The most intense labeling was observed in the Purkinje neurons, which were stained all over the cell including the distal ramifications of the dendritic tree. Remarkably the SERCA2b labeling in neuronal cells of the hypothalamic area and the substantia nigra was very weak. The possible physiological significance of these results is discussed.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Selective excitatory amino acid- and GABAB-receptor antagonists were used to examine the role these receptors play in epileptiform burst discharge elicited by blocking GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition in hippocampal slice cultures of the rat. Application of bicuculline caused a single ictal burst followed by interictal bursting. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, reduced the depolarizing envelope underlying interictal discharge, and accentuated the appearance of concomitant slow oscillatory potentials, which occurred synchronously in all CA3 cells. The non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, 6-nitro-7sulphamoyl-benzo(F) quinoxaline and 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, blocked interictal bursting at high concentrations, and low concentrations of 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione selectively eliminated the slow oscillations in an all-or-none manner, leaving the depolarizing envelope. No effects of either metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists or of dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonists or antagonists on evoked interictal discharge were observed. 6-Cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione-resistant interictal-like discharge could be obtained in the presence of bicuculline when the external Mg2+ concentration was reduced from 1.5-0.5 mM. The GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 35348 prolonged individual evoked interictal bursts, and caused the appearance of spontaneous ictal-like discharges. The implications of these results are discussed with regard to the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to potential therapeutic intervention.',\n",

Six hours after kainic acid-induced seizures, Y1 receptor mRNA levels decreased by 80% in granule cells and concomitantly increased (by 75%) in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Subsequently, persistent decreases in Y1 mRNA were seen, both in the stratum granulosum and in CA2. Changes in mRNA concentrations were accompanied by a transient, although non-significant, increase in [125I][Pro34]PYY binding in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus after 4-6 h which was succeeded by a lasting decrease in binding which indicates a persistent down-regulation of Y1 receptors in hippocampal areas in kainic acid-induced epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Two-pore-domain potassium (K(+)) channels are substrates for resting K(+) currents in neurons. They are major targets for endogenous modulators, as well as for clinically important compounds such as volatile anesthetics. In the current study, we report on the CNS distribution in the rat and mouse of mRNA encoding seven two-pore-domain K(+) channel family members: TASK-1 (KCNK3), TASK-2 (KCNK5), TASK-3 (KCNK9), TREK-1 (KCNK2), TREK-2 (KCNK10), TRAAK (KCNK4), and TWIK-1 (KCNK1). All of these genes were expressed in dorsal root ganglia, and for all of the genes except TASK-2, there was a differential distribution in the CNS. For TASK-1, highest mRNA accumulation was seen in the cerebellum and somatic motoneurons. TASK-3 was much more widely distributed, with robust expression in all brain regions, with particularly high expression in somatic motoneurons, cerebellar granule neurons, the locus ceruleus, and raphe nuclei and in various nuclei of the hypothalamus. TREK-1 was highest in the striatum and in parts of the cortex (layer IV) and hippocampus (CA2 pyramidal neurons). mRNA for TRAAK also was highest in the cortex, whereas expression of TREK-2 was primarily restricted to the cerebellar granule cell layer. There was widespread distribution of TWIK-1, with highest levels in the cerebellar granule cell layer, thalamic reticular nucleus, and piriform cortex. The differential expression of each of these genes likely contributes to characteristic excitability properties in distinct populations of neurons, as well as to diversity in their susceptibility to modulation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The associative network of hippocampal CA3 is thought to contribute to rapid formation of contextual memory from one-trial learning, but the network mechanisms underlying decorrelation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 is largely unknown. Kv1.2 expressions in rodent CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) are polarized to distal apical dendrites, and its downregulation specifically enhances dendritic responses to perforant pathway (PP) synaptic inputs. We found that haploinsufficiency of Kv1.2 (Kcna2+/-) in CA3-PCs, but not Kv1.1 (Kcna1+/-), lowers the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) at PP-CA3 synapses, and that the Kcna2+/- mice are normal in discrimination of distinct contexts but impaired in discrimination of similar but slightly distinct contexts. We further examined the neuronal ensembles in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), which represent the two similar contexts using in situ hybridization of immediate early genes, Homer1a and Arc. The size and overlap of CA3 ensembles activated by the first visit to the similar contexts were not different between wild type and Kcna2+/- mice, but these ensemble parameters diverged over training days between genotypes, suggesting that abnormal plastic changes at PP-CA3 synapses of Kcna2+/- mice is responsible for the impaired pattern separation. Unlike CA3, DG ensembles were not different between two genotype mice. The DG ensembles were already separated on the first day, and their overlap did not further evolve. Eventually, the Kcna2+/- mice exhibited larger CA3 ensemble size and overlap upon retrieval of two contexts, compared to wild type or Kcna1+/- mice. These results suggest that sparse LTP at PP-CA3 synapse probably supervised by mossy fiber inputs is essential for gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Histamine induces KCNQ channel-dependent gamma oscillations in rat hippocampus via activation of the H1 receptor.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Histamine is an aminergic neurotransmitter, which regulates wakefulness, arousal and attention in the central nervous system. Histamine receptors have been the target of efforts to develop pro-cognitive drugs to treat disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Cognitive functions including attention are closely associated with gamma oscillations, a rhythmical electrical activity pattern in the 30-80\\xa0Hz range, which depends on the synchronized activity of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons. We set out to explore whether histamine has a role in promoting gamma oscillations in the hippocampus. Using in-situ hybridization we demonstrate that histamine receptor subtypes 1, 2 and 3 are expressed in stratum pyramidale of area CA3 in rats. We show that both pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons depolarize and increase action potential firing in response to histamine in\\xa0vitro. The activation of histamine receptors generates dose-dependent, transient gamma oscillations in area CA3 of the hippocampus - the locus of the gamma rhythm generator. We also demonstrate that this histamine effect is independent of muscarinic receptors. Using specific antagonists we provide evidence that histamine gamma rhythmogenesis specifically depends on the H1 receptor. Histamine also depolarized both pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons and increased membrane resistance in pyramidal cells. The increased membrane resistance is potentially mediated by the inhibition of potassium channels because application of the KCNQ channel opener ICA110381 abolished the oscillations. Taken together our data demonstrate a novel and physiological mechanism for generating gamma oscillations in hippocampus and suggest a role for KCNQ channels in this cognition-relevant brain activity.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The differential formation of excitatory (glutamate-mediated) and inhibitory (GABA-mediated) synapses is a critical step for the proper functioning of the brain. An imbalance in these synapses may lead to various neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome and epilepsy. Synapses are formed through communication between the appropriate synaptic partners. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of specific synaptic types are not known. Here we show that two members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, FGF22 and FGF7, promote the organization of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals, respectively, as target-derived presynaptic organizers. FGF22 and FGF7 are expressed by CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. The differentiation of excitatory or inhibitory nerve terminals on dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons is specifically impaired in mutants lacking FGF22 or FGF7. These presynaptic defects are rescued by postsynaptic expression of the appropriate FGF. FGF22-deficient mice are resistant to epileptic seizures, and FGF7-deficient mice are prone to them, as expected from the alterations in excitatory/inhibitory balance. Differential effects of FGF22 and FGF7 involve both their distinct synaptic localizations and their use of different signalling pathways. These results demonstrate that specific FGFs act as target-derived presynaptic organizers and help to organize specific presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the rat, neonatal gamma-irradiation of the hippocampus induces a selective destruction of dentate granule cells and prevents the development of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell connection. In the absence of mossy fiber input, the CA3 pyramidal neurons exhibit morphological alterations and rats deprived of dentate granule cells fail to develop kainate-induced epileptic activity in the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Neonatal elimination of the granule cells also impairs learning and memory tasks in adult rats. In the present work, we assessed by in situ hybridization and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, whether in the pyramidal layers, the absence of mossy fiber input alters the expression of a number of genes involved in activity-dependent signal transduction, in GABAergic neurotransmitter signaling and in neurite development via microtubule organization. Surprisingly, we show that the expression and the developmentally regulated alternative splicing of the genes we examined in the developing hippocampus are not altered in the pyramidal neurons, whether the dentate granule afferents are present or absent. Our results suggest that in the CA3 pyramidal layer, the developmental expression patterns of the mRNAs we studied are independent of extrinsic cues provided by mossy fiber input.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Numerous studies have demonstrated that early adverse experiences are associated with the development of susceptibility to stress later in life. Although it is known that early experience of adversity, such as neonatal isolation, maternal separation, and low maternal care, enhances the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenalaxis in rodents, the detailed mechanism underlying stress susceptibility induced by early adversity remains to be elucidated. Since neurotrophins have been shown to have a neuroprotective effect, we examined the influence of repeated neonatal isolation on expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), glia cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin-3 mRNA in the hippocampus of juvenile and adult rats subsequently exposed immobilization stress, using real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. Neonatal isolation did not affect the basal hippocampal expression of these neurotrophin mRNAs in either juvenile or adult rats not subsequently exposed to immobilization. Similarly, there was a significant interaction between neonatal isolation and immobilization that affected the expression of NGF and GDNF mRNAs. Neonatal isolation attenuated the induction of NGF mRNA in both groups of rats and decreased GDNF mRNA in juvenile rats in response to immobilization. The decreased induction of NGF mRNA and reduced GDNF mRNA in response to immobilization was found in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer and dentate gyrus granular cell layer in the hippocampus of adult rats that had been subjected to neonatal isolation. These findings suggest that susceptibility to stress arising from prior neonatal isolation might be a result of decreased neuroprotective support through NGF and GDNF.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The axonal growth-associated protein GAP-43 is believed to play some role in the synaptic remodelling that takes place in the hippocampus of adult rats after certain experimental lesions. GAP-43 mRNA is highly expressed in adult CA3 pyramidal cells but almost absent in the dentate granule cells. We analysed whether the sprouting of granule cell axons, the mossy fibres of the hippocampus, caused by kainic acid-induced seizures in adult rats was associated with any induction of GAP-43 mRNA in granule cells and with any changes in the immunostaining pattern of GAP-43 in the hippocampus. Increased GAP-43 mRNA expression was found to be induced in granule cells 18, 24 and 30 h after a systemic injection of kainic acid which induced generalized seizures in adult rats, and returned to control levels by 48 h post-treatment. No effect was observed in other regions of the hippocampus. However, when kainic acid was injected into 15-day-old rats, which responded with generalized seizures but no sprouting of mossy fibres, there was no induction of GAP-43 mRNA in the granule cells, suggesting a close relation between GAP-43 expression and sprouting of these cells. Seven days after kainic acid injections, GAP-43 immunostaining was decreased in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus except for a thin supragranular band, whereas 30 days after treatment all animals showed increased GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the whole inner molecular layer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Stratum (st.) radiatum interneurons represent a heterogeneous class of hippocampal cells with as yet poorly characterized physiological properties. Intracellular staining with biocytin, in situ hybridization, and patch-clamp recording have been combined to investigate the morphological and electrophysiological properties of these cells in the CA3 hippocampal region in young rats [postnatal days 10 to 21 (P10-21)]. Labeled cells presented a heterogeneous morphology with various soma shapes, often found multipolar, and dendritic arborizations confined to st. radiatum. The passive membrane properties of these st. radiatum interneurons showed instead no significant differences between P10 and P21. Low resting potential, high-input resistance, and short time constants characterized CA3 st. radiatum interneurons, which were silent at rest. Action potentials, elicited by brief current pulses, were lower and shorter than in pyramidal cells and followed by a Ca(2+)-dependent medium-duration afterhyperpolarizing potential (mAHP). Prolonged depolarizing current injection generated trains of action potentials that fired at constant frequency after a slight accommodation. The maximum steady-state firing rate was 31 +/- 4 (SD) Hz. Hyperpolarizing current pulses revealed a prominent inward rectification characterized by a \"sag,\" followed by a depolarizing rebound that triggered action potentials. Sag and anodal brake excitation were blocked by Cs(+), suggesting that they were mediated by a hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance (I(h)). In the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium, biphasic tail currents were elicited in voltage clamp after a depolarizing step inducing Ca(2+) influx. Tail currents presented a fast Ca(2+)-activated and apamin-sensitive component (I(AHP)) and were further reduced by carbachol. The presence of I(AHP) was consistent with the high expression level of the apamin-sensitive SK2 subunit transcript in CA3 st. radiatum interneurons as detected by in situ hybridization. Different pharmacological agents were shown to affect the afterhyperpolarizing potential as well as the firing properties of st. radiatum interneurons. Exposure to Ca(2+)-free solutions mainly affected the late phase of repolarization and strongly reduced the mAHP. The mAHP was also attenuated by carbachol and by apamin, suggesting it to be partly mediated by I(AHP). Reduction of the mAHP increased the interneuron firing frequency. In conclusion, st. radiatum interneurons of CA3 hippocampal region represent a class of nonpyramidal cells with action potentials followed by an AHP of relatively short duration, partially generated by apamin and carbachol-sensitive conductances involved in the regulation of the cell firing rate.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus is a key brain structure for the encoding of new experiences and environments. Hippocampal activity shows distinct oscillatory patterns, but the relationships between oscillations and memory are not well understood. Here we describe bursts of hippocampal approximately 23-30 Hz (beta2) oscillations in mice exploring novel, but not familiar, environments. In marked contrast to the relatively invariant approximately 8 Hz theta rhythm, beta2 power was weak during the very first lap of the novel environment, increased sharply as the mice reencountered their start point, then persisted for only a few minutes. Novelty-evoked oscillations reflected precise synchronization of individual neurons, and participating pyramidal cells showed a selective enhancement of spatial specificity. Through focal viral manipulations, we found that novelty-evoked oscillations required functional NMDA receptors in CA3, a subregion critical for fast oscillations in vitro. These findings suggest that beta2 oscillations indicate a hippocampal dynamic state that facilitates the formation of unique contextual representations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Removal of synaptic connections following a partial deafferentation lesion results in a sprouting of remaining afferents that terminate near the denervated area. However, while the ability to form new synapses in response to injury has been reported in both young and aged rats, previous studies have suggested that the injury-induced response in the hippocampus of aged rats may be delayed and/or not as extensive as compared to young adults. Given that growth associated proteins are central for the regulation of neurite outgrowth during both development and regeneration, we were interested in determining if the magnitude and time course of the sprouting response of hippocampal neurons to deafferentation might correlate with induction of growth associated proteins and whether these parameters could be modulated with age. For our studies we used the Holmes fiber stain to determine the expansion of the C/A fiber plexus following denervation and compared the time course of the sprouting response with that observed by in situ hybridization for the neurite outgrowth proteins, growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43), superior cervical ganglion-10 (SCG-10), and neurofilament-68 (NF-68) at various time points after the lesion for each age group. We found that the commissural/associational (C/A) fiber plexus expanded by 45% in young adult rats at 30 and 45 d postlesion and was accompanied by a significant increase in expression of GAP-43 mRNA in both ipsilateral and contralateral hilar and CA3 pyramidal neurons, the cell bodies of origin for the C/A pathway. In contrast, a dampened sprouting response was observed in aged rats at all time points postlesion and coincided with a lack of induction of any of the growth-associated proteins. These results suggest that GAP-43 is involved in outgrowth of C/A axons in the hippocampus in response to a partial deafferentation lesion. However, factors that stimulate neurite outgrowth and upregulate GAP-43 mRNA in response to a partial deafferentation lesion diminish with age.',\n",

Within the hippocampus, electrophysiology and lesion and imaging studies demonstrate functional heterogeneity along the septotemporal axis, although precise underlying circuitry and molecular substrates remain uncharacterized. Application of unbiased statistical component analyses to genome-scale hippocampal gene expression data revealed robust septotemporal molecular heterogeneity, leading to the identification of a large cohort of genes with robust regionalized hippocampal expression. Manual mapping of heterogeneous CA3 pyramidal neuron expression patterns demonstrates an unexpectedly complex molecular parcellation into a relatively coherent set of nine expression domains in the septal/temporal and proximal/distal axes with reciprocal, nonoverlapping boundaries. Unique combinatorial profiles of adhesion molecules within these domains suggest corresponding differential connectivity, which is demonstrated for CA3 projections to the lateral septum using retrograde labeling. This complex, discrete molecular architecture provides a novel paradigm for predicting functional differentiation across the full septotemporal extent of the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'It has previously been shown that adrenalectomy (ADX) produces apoptosis in the granule cell of the dentate gyrus (DG), and that this effect is prevented by corticosterone replacement. Thus, we have investigated how this phenomenon takes place in rat hippocampus using in situ hybridization. The expression of the pro-apoptotic gene bax was measured in the pyramidal cell fields and in the DG. After 5 days of ADX, there was a significant increase in bax mRNA levels in the suprapyramidal layer of the DG, an effect prevented by corticosterone replacement. The mRNA of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene was expressed in CA3 and DG. ADX increased bcl-2 mRNA levels, but only in the suprapyramidal layer of the DG, an effect that was prevented by corticosterone administration. It is concluded that the up-regulation of bax may explain the apoptosis observed in DG after ADX, while the bcl-2 induction may correspond to a compensatory mechanism protecting the cells from death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Animal models of chronic stress, such as 21 days of 6h/daily restraint stress cause changes in neuronal morphology in the hippocampus and alter behaviour. These changes are partly mediated by the glucocorticoids. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to study how this particular chronic stress paradigm influences expression of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, (2) to study the effect of previous repeated restraint stress on the behaviours executed in the forced swim test (FST) (e.g. a novel inescapable stress situation) and (3) to investigate the modulating effect of electroconvulsive stimulations (ECS) on the neural and behavioural effects of the stress paradigm. The study shows that restraint stress lowered glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels in all hippocampal regions, including the CA3 region which is the site of the characteristic dendritic reorganization seen in this model. Furthermore, stressed rats displayed higher increases in immobility and decreased latency to immobility subjected to the novel stressor of the FST than non-stressed rats. ECS abolished both the neural and behavioural effects of the restraint stress and thus protected against the deleterious effects of the stress paradigm. The clinical relevance of these findings is discussed.',\n",

The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 442 amino acids belonging to the proteoglycan family. The mouse brain testican core protein is 95% identical to its human testicular counterpart. In situ hybridization investigations revealed that mouse testican mRNA is mainly present in a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons localized in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. An immunocytochemical approach, with antibodies directed against an overexpressed chimeric antigen, produced in bacterial systems, showed that testican is associated with the postsynaptic region of these pyramidal neurons. Testican includes several putative functional domains related to extracellular or pericellular proteins associated with binding and/or regulatory functions. On the basis of its structural organization and its occurrence in postsynaptic areas, this proteoglycan might contribute to various neuronal mechanisms in the central nervous system.',\n",

Overall, the distribution patterns overlapped but were partially distinct. In the hippocampus, the intense hybridization signals for both GAP-43 and SCG10 mRNAs were observed in the pyramidal cell layer of Ammon's horn, especially in CA3 subfields. The intense hybridization signals were also observed in the stratum oriens of Ammon's horn and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. In the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, many GAP-43 mRNA-positive cells were observed, whereas a few positive cells with weak signals were observed for SCG10 mRNA. Throughout the subicular complex, the hybridization signals for both mRNAs were weak. In the entorhinal cortex, both mRNAs were abundant in the caudal field. These subregion-specific expression of the growth-associated proteins may reflect the functional specialization regarding plasticity in each region of the monkey hippocampal formation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Non-radioactive in situ hybridization using complementary RNA and oligonucleotide probes was applied in order to clearly identify the cell types expressing GLT1 and to show their regional distribution in the central nervous system of the rat. The results were compared with immunocytochemical data achieved using an antibody against a synthetic GLT1 peptide. The study showed that GLT1 was expressed in astrocytes and Bergmann glia which were identified by the detection of an astrocytic marker protein. Additionally, subsets of neurons in different brain regions (e.g., CA3/4 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, endopiriform nucleus) were labelled by in situ hybridization. In other cell types of the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, epithelal cells of the choroid plexus, tanycytes), GLT1 expression was not detectable. The generally dense astrocytic immunolabelling of the gray matter of the brain showed an even higher intensity in regions reported to show high glutamatergic activity and astrocytic glutamate metabolism (e.g., the termination field of the glutamatergic perforant path in the hippocampus). On the basis of the cellular regional distribution of the GLT1 messenger RNA and protein demonstrated in the present study, it is reasonable to assume that this high affinity transporter is of importance for the maintenance of adequate extraneuronal glutamate levels.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies have identified a multi-component receptor system for the neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its homolog, neurturin (NTN), comprising the signaling tyrosine kinase, Ret and multiple GPI-linked binding proteins, GDNF family receptor alpha-1 and alpha-2 (GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2). In the present study the localization of c-ret and GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs was assessed in the developing rat brain from postnatal day 4 to 70 by in situ hybridization histochemistry, using specific [35S]-labeled oligonucleotides. GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs were differentially distributed throughout the brain at all ages studied, particularly in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and regions of the thalamus and hypothalamus - both distributions overlapping but different to that of c-ret mRNA. C-ret mRNA was abundant in areas such as the lateral habenula, reticular thalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, cranial motor nuclei, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. GFRalpha-1 mRNA was abundant in dorsal endopiriform nucleus, medial habenula, reticular thalamic nucleus, pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampus, substantia nigra pars compacta and in cranial motor nuclei. GFRalpha-2 mRNA was highly expressed in many regions including olfactory bulb, lateral olfactory tract nucleus, neocortical layers IV and VI, septum, zona incerta, and arcuate and interpeduncular nuclei. GFRalpha-2 mRNA was detected in the pyramidal cell layers (CA3) of hippocampus at P4 and P7, but was no longer detectable at P14 and beyond, including P70 (adult). GFRalpha-2 mRNA was also detected in Purkinje cells throughout the cerebellum in young postnatal rats, but was enriched in the posterior lobes at P28 and P70. These localization studies support evidence of GDNF/NTN as target-derived and autocrine/paracrine trophic factors in developing brain pathways and earlier suggestions of unique and complex signaling mechanisms for these factors via a family of receptors. Strong expression of GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs in adult brain suggests possible non-trophic functions of GDNF/NTN, as described for other neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The production and release of the corticosteroids, namely the glucocorticoids and the mineralocorticoids, are regulated by various stimuli, including stress. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic exposure to stress or to stress levels of glucocorticoids produces atrophy of the apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. This stress-induced dendritic remodeling is blocked by the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin, which suppresses glutamate release, and also by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. These results suggest an interaction between glucocorticoids and excitatory amino acids in the development of stress-induced atrophy of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Since nitric oxide is proposed to play an important role in mediating both the physiological and pathophysiological actions of excitatory amino acids, we examined the regulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA expression by corticosterone and phenytoin in the rat hippocampus. The expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and granule neurons of the dentate gyrus was unaffected by 21-day administration of corticosterone (40 mg/kg), phenytoin (40 mg/kg) or the combination of corticosterone and phenytoin. However, in hippocampal interneurons, corticosterone/ phenytoin co-administration led to a significant reduction in neuronal nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA levels when compared with vehicle controls. These results suggest that, during exposure to stress levels of corticosterone, phenytoin inhibits glucocorticoid-induced atrophy of CA3 pyramidal neurons by reducing neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression in hippocampal interneurons. Moreover, these results may provide another example of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus mediated by nitric oxide synthase.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. We have explored the effects of targeted disruption of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor epsilon 1 or epsilon 2 subunit gene on NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA EPSCs) and long-term potentiations (LTPs) at the two types of synapse in mouse hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons: those formed by the commissural/associational (C/A) and fimbrial (Fim) inputs. 2. Electrophysiological experiments were performed in hippocampal slices prepared from both wild-type and epsilon 1- or epsilon 2-disrupted mice using extracellular and whole-cell patch recording techniques. To assess the epsilon 1, epsilon 2 and zeta 1 subunit expression at cellular levels, we performed non-isotopic in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes. 3. We could record EPSCs in response to the stimulations to either of the C/A and Fim afferents from a single CA3 pyramidal neuron. The epsilon 1, epsilon 2 and zeta 1 subunits were expressed together in individual CA3 neurons. 4. The epsilon 1 subunit disruption selectively reduced NMDA EPSCs and LTP in the C/A-CA3 synapse without significantly affecting those in the Fim-CA3 synapse, whereas the epsilon 2 subunit mutation diminished NMDA EPSCs and LTP in the Fim-CA3 synapse with no appreciable functional modifications in the C/A-CA3 synapse. 5. These results suggest that NMDA receptors with different subunit compositions function within a single CA3 pyramidal cell in a synapse-selective manner.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) play an important role in synaptic plasticity and brain development. We have previously shown that NR1-pan mRNA is significantly increased in the hippocampus of rats chronically exposed to low levels of lead (Pb(2+)) during development [T.R. Guilarte, J.L. McGlothan, Hippocampal NMDA receptor mRNA undergoes subunit specific changes during developmental lead exposure, Brain Res., 790 (1998) 98-107]. It is not known whether this Pb(2+)-induced increase in NR1-pan mRNA is associated with changes in specific splice isoforms. To study this effect, we used in situ hybridization of oligonucleotides to probe for the NR1-a, NR1-b, NR1-1, NR1-2, and NR1-4 isoforms which are most abundantly expressed in the rat hippocampus. Developmental exposure to increasing levels of Pb(2+) resulted in significant increases in NR1-a mRNA throughout the pyramidal and granule cell layers of the rat hippocampus at postnatal day 14 (PN14). NR1-b mRNA was increased in the pyramidal cell layer of Pb(2+)-exposed rats at PN21. Splicing of the C-terminus cassettes was also regulated by developmental exposure to Pb(2+). NR1-2 mRNA was increased in CA4 pyramidal cells and in dentate granule cells of PN21 Pb(2+)-exposed rats. Notably, expression of NR1-4 mRNA in CA3 pyramidal cells was increased in Pb(2+)-exposed rats at PN14 and decreased at PN21. No significant Pb(2+) effect was measured for NR1-1 mRNA expression. These data indicate that alternative splicing of the NR1 gene shows selective anatomical and temporal regulation by Pb(2+) in the developing rat hippocampus. This study provides further support to the hypothesis that NMDARs are important targets for Pb(2+)-induced neurotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry, we have investigated in embryonic and postnatal rat nervous tissue the localization and cellular sites of synthesis of glypican, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Glypican immunoreactivity is present in the marginal layer (prospective white matter) and in the dorsal root entry zone of E13-16 spinal cord, as well as in the optic nerve and retina at this stage, but does not appear at significant levels in brain until approximately E19. The proteoglycan shows a wide distribution in grey matter and axonal projections of postnatal brain, including the hippocampal formation, the parallel fibers of cerebellar granule cells, and in the medulla and brainstem. Northern analysis demonstrated high levels of glypican mRNA in brain and skeletal muscle, and in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that glypican mRNA was especially prominent in cerebellar granule cells, large motor neurons in the brainstem, and CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Our immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization results indicate that glypican is predominantly a neuronal membrane proteoglycan in the late embryonic and postnatal rat central nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In adult rats, kainic acid induces status epilepticus and delayed, selective cell loss of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3. In pup rats, kainate induces status epilepticus but not the accompanying neuronal cell death. The precise mechanisms underlying this age-dependent vulnerability to seizure-induced cell death are not understood. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are developmentally and spatially regulated throughout the hippocampus and are implicated in seizure-induced damage. In the present study we used in situ hybridization to examine possible changes in mGluR expression at the level of the hippocampus after status epilepticus in postnatal day 10 (P10) pup and adult (P40) rats. Status epilepticus did not alter expression of mGluR1, mGluR3, or mGluR5 mRNAs. In pup and adult rats, status epilepticus induced a reduction in expression of mGluR2 mRNA in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. This change could lead to augmented glutamate release at mossy fiber synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells and thereby promote hyperexcitation. In pup but not adult rats, mGluR4 mRNA expression was enhanced in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Upregulation of presynaptic mGluR4 in pup CA3 neurons could lead to reduced transmitter release from CA3 axons, including recurrent collaterals, thereby reducing vulnerability of neonatal CA3 neurons to seizure-induced damage. These findings indicate that status epilepticus affects mGluR expression in a gene- and cell-specific manner, and that these changes vary with the developmental stage.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chronic stress evokes profound structural and molecular changes in the hippocampus, which may underlie spatial memory deficits. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) mediate some of the rapid effects of stress on dendritic spine morphology and modulate learning and memory, thus providing a potential molecular basis for impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial memory by repeated stress exposure. Using adult male mice with CRHR1 conditionally inactivated in the forebrain regions, we investigated the role of CRH-CRHR1 signaling in the effects of chronic social defeat stress on spatial memory, the dendritic morphology of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons, and the hippocampal expression of nectin-3, a synaptic cell adhesion molecule important in synaptic remodeling. In chronically stressed wild-type mice, spatial memory was disrupted, and the complexity of apical dendrites of CA3 neurons reduced. In contrast, stressed mice with forebrain CRHR1 deficiency exhibited normal dendritic morphology of CA3 neurons and mild impairments in spatial memory. Additionally, we showed that the expression of nectin-3 in the CA3 area was regulated by chronic stress in a CRHR1-dependent fashion and associated with spatial memory and dendritic complexity. Moreover, forebrain CRHR1 deficiency prevented the down-regulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression by chronic stress but induced increased body weight gain during persistent stress exposure. These findings underscore the important role of forebrain CRH-CRHR1 signaling in modulating chronic stress-induced cognitive, structural and molecular adaptations, with implications for stress-related psychiatric disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The doublecortin (DCX) gene, mutated in X-linked human lissencephaly, has 2 close paralogs, doublecortin-like kinase 1 and 2 (Dclk1 and 2). In this study we attempted to better understand the dramatic differences between human and mouse DCX/Dcx-deficient phenotypes, focusing on the Dclk genes which are likely to compensate for Dcx function in the mouse. Using sequence database screens, Northern blot analyses and in situ hybridization experiments, we characterized the developmental transcripts of Dclk1 and 2, questioning their conservation between mouse and human, and their similarity to Dcx. Like Dcx, Dcx-like transcripts of the Dclk1 gene are expressed in postmitotic neurons in the developing cortex. No changes of expression were observed at the RNA level for these transcripts in Dcx knockout mice. However, a minor change in expression at the protein level was detected. The Dclk2 gene is less well characterized than Dclk1 and we show here that it is expressed both in proliferating cells and postmitotic neurons, with a notably strong expression in the ventral telencephalon. No major differences in Dclk2 expression at the RNA and protein levels were identified comparing Dcx knockout and wild-type brains. We also analyzed Dclk1 and 2 expression in the hippocampal CA3 region which, unlike the neocortex, is abnormal in Dcx knockout mice. Interestingly, each transcript was expressed in CA3 neurons, including in the heterotopic pyramidal layer of Dcx knockout animals, but is presumably not able to compensate for a lack of Dcx. These results, in addition to characterizing the transcript diversity of an important family of genes, should facilitate further studies of compensation in Dcx-deficient mice.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have used the Golgi method and Golgi electron microscopic techniques to analyze the axonal arborization and efferent connections of spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the CA3 region and hilus of the rat hippocampal formation. In the hilus, the axons of spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons sent out numerous collaterals that arborized in the hilar region and the molecular layer. In the CA3 region, these axons extended mainly to the stratum radiatum and pyramidal layer but also to the stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Axonal varicosities were distributed widely throughout the axonal collaterals. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the axon terminals of spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons established synaptic contacts mainly with dendritic shafts. We next analyzed the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67) mRNAs in spiny nonpyramidal neurons that were identified by calretinin immunoreactivity. We found that spiny calretinin-positive neurons in the CA3 region and hilus of the rat hippocampal formation expressed the two isoforms of GAD: GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs. These findings show that the spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons of hippocampus give rise to local axonal arborizations, suggesting that they are inhibitory.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT) catalyzes the transamination of the essential branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) with alpha-ketoglutarate. BCAT exists in two isoforms: one cytosolic (BCATc), mainly expressed in the nervous system, and the other mitochondrial (BCATm), present in a greater number of tissues. We previously showed that BCATc mRNA and protein expression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus is up-regulated by exogenous administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) following lesion of the visual cortex in newborn rats. Here, we analyzed the expression of BCATc mRNA in the brain of transgenic mice overexpressing the rat BDNF cDNA under the control of the alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alphaCaMKII) promoter. In these animals, BDNF is overexpressed in the telencephalon starting from the second postnatal week. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments showed that BCATc mRNA is overexpressed in restricted regions of the cerebral cortex (parietal area) and hippocampus (hilus and CA3 pyramidal cell layer) of adult BDNF transgenic mice respect to wild-type animals. These differences between wt and BDNF mice were not detected in animals of 1 week of age. These results demonstrate that the expression of the BCATc gene in the brain is specifically regulated by BDNF in a time- and region-dependent fashion.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution of voltage-dependent calcium channel subunits in the central nervous system may provide information about the function of these channels. The present study examined the distribution of three alpha-1 subunits, alpha 1A, alpha 1B and alpha 1E, in the normal human hippocampal formation and parahippocampal gyrus using the techniques of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. All three subunit mRNAs appeared to be similarly localized, with high levels of expression in the dentate granule and CA pyramidal layer. At the protein level, alpha 1A, alpha 1B and alpha 1E subunits were differentially localized. In general, alpha 1A-immunoreactivity was most intense in cell bodies and dendritic processes, including dentate granule cells, CA3 pyramidal cells and entorhinal cortex pre-alpha and pri-alpha cells. The alpha 1B antibody exhibited relatively weak staining of cell bodies but stronger staining of neuropil, especially in certain regions of high synaptic density such as the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum lucidum and radiatum of the CA regions. The alpha 1E staining pattern shared features in common with both alpha 1A and alpha 1B, with strong immunoreactivity in dentate granule, CA3 pyramidal and entorhinal cortex pri-alpha cells, as well as staining of the CA3 stratum lucidum. These findings suggest regions in which particular subunits may be involved in synaptic communication. For example, comparison of alpha 1B and alpha 1E staining in the CA3 stratum lucidum with calbindin-immuno-reactivity suggested that these two calcium channels subunits may be localized presynaptically in mossy fibre terminals and therefore may be involved in neurotransmitter release from these terminals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The localization of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) immunoreactivity and mRNA in the adult rat brain was examined by light microscopic and electron microscopic immunohistochemistries, and in situ hybridization. For the purpose of detailed investigation of the distribution and comparison of GR immunoreactivities and mRNAs, specific polyclonal antibodies against a part of the transcription modulation (TR) domain of rat GR were used in the immunohistochemistry, whereas fluorescein-labeled RNA probes, complementary to the TR domain in the GR cDNA were used in the in situ hybridization. In the rat brain, GR immunoreactivity was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus, and the expression of GR mRNA was detected in the cytoplasm. GR-immunoreactive and GR mRNA-containing cells were widely distributed from the olfactory bulb of the forebrain to the gracile-cuneate nuclei of the medulla oblongata. The highest densities of GR-immunoreactive and mRNA-containing cells were observed in the subfields of cerebral cortex, olfactory cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala, septal region, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, trapezoid body, cerebellar cortex, locus coeruleus and dorsal nucleus raphe. The distributional pattern of GR immunoreactivity in many regions was well-correlated with that of GR mRNA, but in the CA3 and CA4 pyramidal layers of the hippocampus, different localization was noted.

       "  'Abstract': 'Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) slow the progression and delay the onset of Alzheimer disease (AD). Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified. Although much effort has recently been focused on the inducible COX-2 isoform, little is known about COX-1 expression in human brain. We report that COX-1 message and immunoreactivity are localized to human hippocampal CA3 and CA4 neurons, granular neurons in neocortical layer IV, and occasional cortical pyramidal neurons. Quantitative in situ hybridization showed no differences between COX-1 mRNA levels in control and AD CA3 hippocampal neurons. COX-1 immunoreactivity was also present in microglial cells in gray and white matter in all brain regions examined. COX-1 appeared to be expressed in microglial cells regardless of their activation state as determined by HLA-DR immunostaining. However, COX-1 immunopositive microglia were found in association with Abeta plaques, and the density of COX-1 immunopositive microglia in AD fusiform cortex was increased. This pattern suggests an overall increase of COX-1 expression in AD. Currently used NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms of cyclooxygenase. The present study shows that COX-1 is widely expressed in human brain, and raises the possibility that COX-1 may contribute to CNS pathology.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling-1, -2, and -3 in the rat hippocampus after seizure: implications for neuromodulation by gp130 cytokines.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Numerous studies have investigated the expression of various cytokine families in the CNS after brain injury. The gp130 or interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines have received a great deal of focus, and it is clear that they exhibit an acute and robust upregulation in various brain injury models. We are interested to determine, however, whether endogenously expressed cytokines in the CNS act in a direct neuromodulatory manner. In an accompanying study, we examined the expression of five gp130 cytokines and their receptors in the lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus. We follow up that study here by trying to determine if gp130 signal transduction occurs in hippocampal principal neurons after seizure. Therefore, using the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and -3 as indices of gp130 signal transduction, we performed a detailed in situ hybridization seizure time-course study in the adult rat hippocampus. For comparison, we also examined SOCS-2, which is involved in insulin-like growth factor signaling. We found that while SOCS-1 and -3 were faintly expressed under basal conditions, only SOCS-3 exhibited a rapid, robust, and transient induction. This occurred first in non-principal cells, which appeared to be glial, peaking at approximately 12 h post-seizure. Subsequently, a robust induction of SOCS-3 occurred in pyramidal and granule neurons, peaking at approximately 24 h. SOCS-2 displayed a relatively higher level of basal expression, particularly in CA3, and a mild and transient downregulation by 24 h. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that seizure-induced gp130 cytokines play a direct neuromodulatory role in the hippocampus. Since in our previous study we did not detect cytokine receptor expression in non-principal cells, it is unclear what elicits SOCS-3 expression in this population.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study compares the mRNA expression pattern for the three glutamate transporters EAAC1, GLT1 and GLAST in rat brain, using a sensitive non-radioactive in situ hybridization technique. The results confirm the predominantly neuronal localization of EAAC1 mRNA, the astroglial and ependymal localization of GLAST mRNA and the astroglial and neuronal localization of GLT1 mRNA. Further, we demonstrate, using a novel differential double hybridization protocol, that the presence of GLT1 mRNA in neurons is more widespread than previously thought, and that it encompasses the majority of neurons in the neocortex, neurons in the external plexiform layer in the olfactory bulb, neurons in dorsal and ventral parts of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the majority of neurons in the anteromedial thalamic nuclei, the CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and neurons in the inferior olive. In addition, we demonstrate marked variations in the expression levels of GLT1 and GLAST mRNAs in different brain areas, suggesting that their mRNA levels are regulated by different mechanisms. Finally, for EAAC1 we demonstrate also a widespread distribution and a marked heterogeneity in the expression levels. EAAC1 is strongly expressed by a heretofore unrecognized group of cells in white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum, fimbria-fornix or anterior commissure. Also, strong EAAC1 expression is present in groups of scattered cells in grey matter areas of much of the forebrain and the cerebellum. These results provide more detailed information about the precise cellular localization of these three glutamate transporters and their regulation at the mRNA level.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 is increased in astrocytes after kainate-induced epileptic seizures.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In the CNS there is a differential distribution of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in neurons and glia. Hippocampal nerve cells contain large amounts of the receptor transcript and protein that are expressed at very low levels in astrocytes. This is unexpected, as mGluR-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis is substantial in cultured astrocytes and is mediated only by mGluR5 in these cells. In order to detect mGluR5 in astrocytes in vivo, we destroyed in a circumscribed part of the hippocampus nerve cells that have high level of receptor expression. Unilateral injection of kainate into the right amygdala produced epileptic seizures, as well as selective degeneration of nerve cells restricted to the ipsilateral CA3 and CA4 regions of the hippocampus, followed by the development of gliosis. In the affected fields only, mGluR5 immunoreactivity was severely reduced 3 days after kainate injection, followed by a progressive reappearance and lasting presence of the receptor protein. Receptor mRNA virtually disappeared from the pyramidal cell layer of the lesioned CA3/4 region. On the other hand, the message level increased persistently in the CA3 stratum lucidum and radiatum, the site of massive astrogliosis. In these sites, mGluR5 mRNA became detectable in double labeling studies in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. We showed previously that growth factors induce a pronounced elevation of mGluR5 expression in cultured astrocytes (Miller et al. J Neurosci 15:-6109, 1995). The well-documented increase in the level of growth factors in the damaged brain may underlie the induction of the receptor expression in astrocytes in vivo, which may also be involved in repair processes in the injured nervous tissue.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Aberrant mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are plastic responses in human temporal lobe epilepsy, and in pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in rodents. Although the morphological features of the hippocampal epileptic reaction have been well documented, the molecular mechanisms underlying these structural changes are not understood. The classic cadherins, calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules, are known to function in development in neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and stabilization. In pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, the expression of N-cadherin mRNA was sharply upregulated and reached a maximum level (1- to 2.5-fold) at 1- to 4 weeks postseizure in the granule cell layer and the pyramidal cell layer of CA3. N-cadherin protein was correspondingly increased and became concentrated in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, consistent with the position of mossy fiber axonal sprouts. Moreover, N-cadherin labeling was punctate; colocalized with definitive synaptic markers, and partially localized on polysialated forms of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)-positive dendrites of granule cells in the inner molecular layer. Our findings show that N-cadherin is likely to be a key factor in responsive synaptogenesis following status epilepticus, where it functions as a mediator of de novo synapse formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A serine proteinase inhibitor, PI-6, is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. In the present study, we investigated the developmental expression of PI-6 in the mouse brain and the effect of experimental ischemia on the expression of PI-6 in the adult brain. Northern blot analysis showed a high level of expression of PI-6 mRNA in brain stem and diencephalon as compared with other regions in the adult brain. The expression of PI-6 mRNA in the whole brain was increased gradually until 11 days after birth and was decreased again in the adult brain. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that the mRNA was localized in pyramidal cell layer of the post-natal hippocampus, especially in CA3 region, and in layer V of the cerebral cortex. In the brain stem, two specific motor nuclei, the facial nucleus and the motor nucleus of trigeminal nerve, which are important to active feeding, were strongly positive for PI-6 mRNA. Brain ischemia induced by bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery led to an increase in PI-6 mRNA expression in the whole brain, accompanied by the degeneration of hippocampal pyramidal cells. These results indicate distinct temporal and spatial expression of PI-6 in the mouse brain and suggest the involvement of PI-6 in the maturation of neurons and degenerative and regenerative processes.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The critical role of basement membrane-independent laminin gamma 1 chain during axon regeneration in the CNS.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'We have addressed the question of whether a family of axon growth-promoting molecules known as the laminins may play a role during axon regeneration in the CNS. A narrow sickle-shaped region containing a basal lamina-independent form of laminin exists in and around the cell bodies and proximal portion of the apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons of the postnatal hippocampus. To understand the possible function of laminin in axon regeneration within this pathway, we have manipulated laminin synthesis at the mRNA level in a slice culture model of the lesioned mossy system. In this model early postnatal mossy fibers severed near the hilus can regenerate across the lesion and elongate rapidly within strata lucidum and pyramidale. In slice cultures of the postnatal day 4 hippocampus, 2 d before lesion and then continuing for 1-5 d after lesion, translation of the gamma1 chain product of laminin was reduced by using antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides and DNA enzymes. In the setting of the lesioned organotypic hippocampal slice, astroglial repair of the lesion and overall glial patterning were unperturbed by the antisense or DNA enzyme treatments. However, unlike controls, in the treated, lesioned slices the vast majority of regenerating mossy fibers could not cross the lesion site; those that did were very much shorter than usual, and they took a meandering course. In a recovery experiment in which the DNA enzyme or antisense oligos were washed away, laminin immunoreactivity returned and mossy fiber regeneration resumed. These results demonstrate the critical role of laminin(s) in an axon regeneration model of the CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2/3 were localized by immunohistochemistry with subunit-specific antibodies in hippocampi removed surgically from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy for the control of seizures. The flip and flop splice variants of the subunits were localized by in situ hybridization histochemistry with specific oligoprobes. In patient hippocampi that were not the seizure focus, the GluR1 subunit proteins were diffusely expressed on the dendrites of neurons in all regions. In contrast, in these same hippocampi, the GluR2/3 subunit proteins were expressed strongly on the soma and proximal dendrites of principal neurons in all regions. The flip variant of these subunits was localized in the hilus and fields of Ammon's Horn (CA), while the flop variants were prominent on the dentate granule cells. In the epileptogenic hippocampus, while immunoreactivity was decreased in all fields that showed neuronal loss, there was an increased expression of GluR1 on the dendritic excrescences on the proximal dendrites of hilar neurons and CA3 pyramidal neurons, as well as expression of GluR2/3 in hilar neuron excrescences. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that the GluR1 immunoreactivity was only in dendritic processes, particularly dense at the postsynaptic membranes. Such expression of GluR1 may provide for an enhanced glutamatergic response by these neurons. GluR2/3 was also significantly increased on the dendrites of dentate granule cells in the epileptogenic hippocampus and may provide some protection against excitotoxic injury by reducing calcium flux into neurons.\",\n",

We examined Dan expression during murine forebrain development from embryonic day 10.5 to postnatal day 14 and found that Dan was expressed in highly specific spatiotemporal patterns. In early telencephalic development, Dan is highly expressed in the fibroblasts covering the cortex. From E12.5-E14.5, Dan is also weakly expressed in a region of neuroepithelium at the medial margin of the telencephalon called the cortical hem. From E17.5 on, Dan is expressed strongly in CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus as well as in the developing thalamus and amygdala. To determine if Dan expression is correlated with the expression of any of its known ligand targets, we examined the expression of GDF-5, -6 and -7 in the forebrain and found that GDF-5 is expressed in Cajal-Retzius cells in Layer I of cortex, immediately adjacent to the expression of Dan in the meninges.',\n",

The anatomical distribution of JP05 mRNA was first described in the central nervous system of the mouse, and recently the human JP05 orphan receptor gene has been cloned. In the present study the distribution of JP05 mRNA was examined in the human forebrain using in situ hybridization analysis. The results revealed a wide but discrete distribution of the transcript with strongly JP05 mRNA expressing cells, presumably neurons, present in the cerebral cortex (layer II), hippocampus (pyramidal CA3 neurons and granule cells), amygdala (basal and periamygdaloid cortical nuclei), in the endopiriform nucleus, diagonal band of Broca, thalamus (nucleus reuniens, parafascicular nucleus) and hypothalamus (posterior, dorsal, and around the medial mammillary). Weaker signals were detected in the deeper cortical layers and throughout the striatum. A few positive cells were evident in the raphe but not in the substantia nigra or pontine nuclei. The results indicate significant similarities between human and mouse brain with regard to JP05 mRNA expression. The distribution patterns of JP05 mRNA in the human brain suggest involvement in control of emotions and of neuroendocrine, cognitive and motor functions.',\n",

CALL is highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, like the mouse ortholog 'close homolog to L1' (Chl1). Chl1 expression levels in the hippocampus of Chl1(+/-) mice were half of those obtained in wild-type littermates, reflecting a gene dosage effect. Timm staining and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry of the hippocampus showed focal groups of ectopic mossy fiber synapses in the lateral CA3 region, outside the trajectory of the infra-pyramidal mossy fiber bundle in Chl1(-/-) and Chl1(+/-) mice. Behavioral assessment demonstrated mild alterations in the Chl1(-/-) animals. In the probe trial of the Morris Water Maze test, Chl1(-/-) mice displayed an altered exploratory pattern. In addition, these mice were significantly more sociable and less aggressive as demonstrated in social exploration tests. The Chl1(+/-) mice showed a phenotypic spectrum ranging from wild-type to knockout behavior. We hypothesize that a 50% reduction of CALL expression in the developing brain results in cognitive deficits. This suggests that the CALL gene at 3p26.3 is a prime candidate for an autosomal form of mental retardation. So far, mutation analysis of the CALL gene in patients with non-specific MR did not reveal any disease-associated mutations.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"N-Acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to position 6 of a non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue. We have cloned human GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase cDNA, based on the sequence homology to cloned cDNA of mouse GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase. The predicted protein sequence of the human enzyme was highly homologous to that of the mouse enzyme; in the 363 amino acid stretch of the catalytic region, the two proteins were nearly identical except for conservative changes in 3 amino acid residues. The expressed enzyme transferred sulfate to GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Gl cNAc. Co-transfection of the enzyme cDNA and fucosyltransferase VII cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in cell surface expression of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase gene is located on human chromosome 7q31. mRNA of the human enzyme was strongly expressed in the bone marrow, peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, brain, spinal cord, ovary, and placenta, and moderate levels of expression were observed in many organs including lymph nodes and thymus. In situ hybridization with the mouse system showed that the transcript was localized in specific regions of the brain, i.e. pyramidal cells in the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus, cerebellar nucleus and Purkinje cells. Among human tumor cells, strong expression of the mRNA was found in MOLT-4 and Jarkat lymphoblastic leukemia cells, Raji lymphoma cells, K-562 chronic myelogeneous leukemia cells, U251 glioma cells, and G361 melanoma cells. Carbohydrate structures synthesized by the sulfotransferase may be involved in various aspects of the differentiation and behavior of blood cells, their progenitor cells, and neurons in the central nervous system.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution of kainate receptor subunit mRNAs in human hippocampus, neocortex and cerebellum, and bilateral reduction of hippocampal GluR6 and KA2 transcripts in schizophrenia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The mRNAs encoding kainic acid (KA) preferring glutamate receptor subunits (GluR5-7, KA1 and KA2) are differentially expressed in rat brain. We have used regional and cellular in situ hybridization histochemistry with subunit-specific 35S-labelled oligodeoxyribonucleotides to examine these mRNAs in adult human hippocampus, neocortex and cerebellum. GluR5 mRNA was detected only in Purkinje cells and a few scattered hippocampal neurons. GluR6 mRNA was relatively abundant in all areas, notably in dentate gyrus, pyramidal neurons of CA3, and cerebellar granule cells, as well as being present in superficial and deep laminae of the neocortex. Moderate signal for GluR7 mRNA was seen in deep laminae of the neocortex with a weak signal in the dentate gyrus; in dipped sections GluR7 mRNA was also apparent over some pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in hippocampus and over putative cerebellar stellate/basket cells. KA1 mRNA was detected in the dentate gyrus but not reliably elsewhere. The expression profile and abundance of KA2 mRNA was similar to that of GluR6 mRNA. For all five transcripts, concurrent hybridization of rat brain sections produced the anticipated distribution of signal. The data indicate that the regional and cellular distribution of KA receptor subunit mRNAs in human hippocampus, neocortex and cerebellum largely parallels that in the corresponding areas of rat brain, albeit at lower levels, especially with regard to GluR5 and KA1 transcripts. In schizophrenia there is a partial loss of hippocampal non-NMDA receptors, but there are no data concerning KA receptor subunit expression. KA2 and GluR6 mRNAs were sufficiently abundant for a comparison in the left and right hippocampus between 11 schizophrenics and 13 controls. Using film autoradiography, both mRNAs were significantly reduced in the schizophrenics, having controlled for the effects of brain pH, post mortem interval and age. GluR6 mRNA was also quantitated in cerebellum, wherein no differences were found between cases and controls. In conjunction with earlier findings of reduced hippocampal GluR1 and GluR2 expression and a loss of [3H]KA binding sites, these data show that schizophrenia is associated with impaired expression of both AMPA- and KA-preferring ionotropic glutamate receptors. These deficits are likely to contribute to the glutamatergic component of the disease pathophysiology.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization histochemistry has revealed a diffuse distribution of the alpha subunit of type II calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM II kinase alpha) mRNA in the neuropil of regions containing CaM II kinase alpha-expressing cells and has led some to propose that it may be expressed in dendrites. In order to determine if CaM II kinase alpha mRNA is expressed in dendrites and if the gene encoding CaM II kinase alpha is regulated in response to synaptic reinnervation, we examined its expression in the hippocampus of normal rats, of rats that had received a unilateral injection of kainic acid and of rats with a unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion. The relatively specific elimination of the CA3 pyramidal cells by kainate lesions precisely correlated with the loss of CaM II kinase alpha cRNA hybridization in the stratum radiatum as well as the stratum pyramidale. Following entorhinal cortex lesions, during the period of new synapse formation in the dentate gyrus, there was no detectable change in the level of CaM II kinase alpha gene expression. These data suggest that CaM II kinase alpha mRNA is expressed in the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells and, therefore, is likely to be expressed in dendrites in other regions of the central nervous system exhibiting CaM II kinase alpha cRNA labeling in the neuropil. However, changes in expression were not found to accompany new synapse formation.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and release from hippocampal neurons is mediated by non-NMDA type glutamate receptors.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'We have examined the influence of glutamate on cortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Kainic acid (KA) produced an upregulation of hippocampal and neocortical BDNF mRNA as well as BDNF protein that was blocked by a non-NMDA antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), but was not affected by the NMDA antagonist 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP7). Basal levels of BDNF mRNA were not affected by NMDA, DNQX, or AP7 treatment. BDNF protein was also increased after kainate exposure with a spatial and temporal course distinct from that seen for the expression of BDNF mRNA. A dramatic shift in BDNF immunoreactivity (-IR) was observed from intracellular compartments to the neuropil surrounding CA3 pyramidal cells 2-3 hr after KA exposure. This shift in localization of BDNF-IR suggests a constitutive release of BDNF at the level of the cell body and dendrites. Moreover, we have localized mRNAs for full-length and truncated trkB, to a co-incident population of neurons and glia. These data suggest the neurons that produce BDNF also express components necessary for a biological response to the same neurotrophic factor. The present study also demonstrates increased BDNF-IR in the mossy fiber terminal zone of hippocampus after exposure to KA, as well as an increase in trkB mRNA, and provides evidence of local release of this neurotrophin into the surrounding neuropil where it would be available for local utilization. The synthesis and putative release of BDNF from somatic and/or dendritic sites within the hippocampus provide evidence of a potential autocrine or paracrine role for BDNF, and establish a local source of trophic support for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and anatomic reorganization in the mature nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis of mRNA, we investigated the changes in the expression of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the rat hippocampal principal neurons in kindling or after electrically induced status epilepticus (SE), two models of limbic epilepsy associated with different chronic sequelae of seizures and seizure-related neuropathology. At the preconvulsive stage 2 of kindling and after three consecutive tonic-clonic seizures (stage 5) but not after a single-discharge (AD), somatostatin and NPY immunoreactivity (IR) were markedly increased in interneurons of the deep hilus and the polymorphic cell layer and their presumed projections to the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Increased mRNA levels were observed in the same neurons. NPY IR and mRNA were highly expressed in pyramidal-shaped basket cells at both stages of kindling. IR was similar two days after stages 2 or 5 of kindling while less pronounced effects were observed one week after kindling completion. Peptide-containing neurons in the hilus appeared well preserved in spite of an average of 24% reduction of Nissl stained cells (p < 0.01) in the stimulated and contralateral hippocampus at stage 5. No sprouting of mossy fibres in the inner molecular layer was found as assessed by Timm staining. Thirty days after SE, somatostatin IR was slightly reduced or similar to controls in the ventral dentate gyrus and molecular layer in four or six rats (SE-I group) while in the two other post-SE rats (SE-II), somatostatin IR was lost. These changes were associated with a different extent of neurodegeneration as assessed by cell counting of Nissl stained sections. In the granule cells/mossy fibres NPY-IR was transiently expressed at stage 2 and after a single AD. Differently, NPY-IR was persistently enhanced in the mossy fibres of all post-SE rats particularly in the SE-II group. In these rats, NPY immunoreactive fibres were detected in the infrapyramidal region of the stratum oriens CA3 and in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus very likely labeling sprouted mossy fibres. In the hippocampus proper of kindled rats, somatostatin and NPY IR were respectively enhanced in the stratum lacunosum moleculare, the subiculum and in the alveus while no significant changes were observed after SE. Changes in peptide expression were bilateral and involved both the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus. The lasting modifications in peptides IR and mRNA expression in distinct neuronal populations of the hippocampus may reflect functional modifications neurons and play a role in limbic epileptogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The sodium channel beta 1 subunit (Na beta 1) is a component of the rat brain voltage-dependent sodium channel. We have used nonradioactive in situ hybridization cytochemical techniques to demonstrate that transcript levels of Na beta 1 are differentially upregulated during postnatal development of several CNS regions, with selective labeling of specific neuronal populations. In the hippocampus, labeling of the pyramidal cell layer (particularly in the CA3 region) and dentate granule cells was initially observed at postnatal day 2 (P2) and P10, respectively, and became progressively more intense with maturation. Labeled cells were first observed in the hilus at P10. In the developing cerebellum, transient labeling was observed in the external granule cell layer beginning at P1 while label increased in the internal granule cell layer up to P21. Purkinje cells showed significant label beginning at P4 and increasing up to P21. Weak signal was seen in neurons of deep nuclei at P1 and increased up to P21. Na beta 1 labeling in the spinal cord was first observed in the ventral horn at P2, and the intensity of labeling in these large motoneurons gradually increased. In addition, there was a ventral-dorsal gradient in this region, with label appearing subsequently in neurons of Rexed laminae IX, VII and VIII, and in the dorsal horn (Rexed laminae I-VI). In these regions, the labeling reached a plateau within the first 2-3 weeks after birth and persisted into the adult rat. The time course and regional heterogeneity of Na beta 1 expression are consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of mature Na+ channels, including Na beta 1, contributes to the development of circuitry that supports complex patterns of electrogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Adult central neurons exhibit significant structural and molecular changes in epilepsy. We have examined changes in two markers of morphological and physiological plasticity, T alpha 1 alpha-tubulin (T alpha 1) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNAs, in response to intermittent (20 Hz, 10 seconds, 1 minute-1) stimulation of the rat perforant path in vivo. Stimulus trains elicited brief (0.5-3 seconds) afterdischarges in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus (DG). Four hours of stimulation caused no significant loss of inhibition in the DG 40-48 hours after stimulation ceased. However, it did lead to an increase in NPY mRNA in neurons of the ipsilateral and, to a lesser extent, contralateral DGs and Ammon's Horn. Many of these were presumably interneurons that normally express NPY. However, dentate granule cells (DGCs), which do not normally express this peptide, also expressed robust levels of NPY mRNA bilaterally. NPY mRNA levels peaked at 4-24 hours and returned to baseline by 48 hours poststimulation. Although 24 hours of stimulation induced a similar increase in interneurons, DGCs showed no detectable NPY mRNA. Afterdischarges were necessary to elevate NPY mRNA expression. Four hours of stimulation elevated T alpha 1 mRNA expression in both ipsilateral and, to a lesser extent, contralateral DGCs; this elevation peaked at 24 hours poststimulation and declined to baseline by 72 hours. Stimulation for 24 hours caused broader changes in T alpha 1 mRNA expression, with increases in DGCs and in CA3 pyramidal cells bilaterally. Acute denervation of the DG did not affect T alpha 1 mRNA level in the hippocampal formation. Elevated synaptic input resulting in afterdischarges, but not necessarily in excitability changes in the DG, led to alterations in the expression of molecular markers of plasticity. These changes may reflect adaptive responses to physiological activation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mRNA levels of protein F1 (also known as GAP-43), and protein kinase C (PKC) subtypes were measured 3 days after the induction of long-term enhancement (also known as long-term potentiation) in the hippocampus of chronically prepared conscious rats by quantitative in situ hybridization. Altered mRNA levels correlated significantly with alternations in synaptic efficacy; such correlations have not been reported previously. Rats with greater synaptic enhancement had lower gene expression in the CA3 subfield of F1/GAP-43 and both beta-PKC and gamma-PKC, but not alpha-PKC. For microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), neurogranin, and the glutamate receptor subtype B-flip, no correlation was observed in any cell field between synaptic enhancement and hybridization to the mRNA. To our surprise, alterations in mRNA levels of F1/GAP-43 and gamma-PKC were highly correlated (r = +0.928, P < 0.001), suggesting coordinate regulation. Since F1/GAP-43 is associated with neurite growth, its lowered expression at 3 days would reduce potential growth, leading to synaptic stabilization. We propose that long-term synaptic change is mediated by gene expression of the very same proteins initially modified posttranslationally.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Trimethyltin syndrome as a hippocampal degeneration model: temporal changes and neurochemical features of seizure susceptibility and learning impairment.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The effects of trimethyltin on the hippocampus were investigated in terms of changes in histology, depth electroencephalography, learning acquisition and memory retention, choline acetyltransferase and neuropeptides, and seizure-induced c-fos messenger RNA expression. The results were as follows. (1) Morphologically, trimethyltin produced a progressive loss of hippocampal CA3 and CA4 pyramidal cells, starting from four days after peroral treatment with trimethyltin hydroxide (9 mg/kg), as described previously. (2) Neurophysiologically, the increased seizure susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol treatment reached a maximum at four days post-trimethyltin and then declined after five days post-trimethyltin. The maximal seizure susceptibility at four days post-trimethyltin was confirmed by the immediate and long-lasting appearance of spike discharge in the hippocampus. However, this was not verified by the expression of c-fos messenger RNA in the hippocampus, which was comparable between trimethyltin-treated and control rats. (3) Behaviorally, the time-courses of aggression and learning impairment were similar to that of the seizure susceptibility. (4) Neurochemically, trimethyltin treatment caused changes of neurochemical markers, which were manifested by the elevation of neuropeptide Y content in the entorhinal cortex, and of choline acetyltransferase in the hippocampal CA3 subfield. Trimethyltin may offer potential as a tool for investigations on the relationship between neuronal death in the hippocampus and the development of seizure susceptibility and learning impairment. Alterations in glucocorticoids, glutamate and neuropeptides may all contribute to the manifestation of the trimethyltin syndrome.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the present study, it is demonstrated that activation of NMDA receptors upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and CA3 pyramidal neurons. BDNF mRNA levels in the granule cells peaked within 4 h, were still evident at 24 h, and returned to control levels within 48 h. In the CA3 region, BDNF mRNA levels were significantly increased at 2 h, peaked at 4 h, and returned to control values by 8 h following NMDA treatment. Finally, the effects of NMDA on BDNF mRNA expression were blocked by AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist. These findings provide evidence that the in vivo activation of NMDA receptors may regulate the expression of this neurotrophin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kindled seizures are widely used as a model for epileptogenesis. Although the achievement of kindling criterion is known to require time to develop, the precise developmental period has not been identified. We now report that optimal achievement of the kindling criterion in the Sprague-Dawley rat is associated with a critical inter-stimulus interval of 24 to 26 days. We show that highly efficient kindling can be achieved with only two subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazole so long as they are given 25 days apart. Using Northern blot hybridization we show that the increased seizure susceptibility at 25 days coincides with an increased expression of the plasticity-associated proteins, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) mRNAs in the hippocampus. By in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry on tissue sections, we also show an increased expression for GAP-43 in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, mossy fibers, and pyramidal cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The demonstration of a long, defined developmental interval for inducing the kindling criterion should enable a dissection of the cellular and genetic events underlying this phenomenon in the rat.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on metallothionein-I (MT-I) and MT-III expression in the brain has been studied in transgenic mice expressing IL-6 under the regulatory control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene promoter (GFAP-IL6 mice), which develop chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that GFAP-IL6 (G16-low expressor line, and G36-high expressor line) mice had strongly increased MT-I mRNA levels in the cerebellum (Purkinje and granular layers of the cerebellar cortex and basal nuclei) and, to a lesser degree, in thalamus (only G36 line) and hypothalamus, whereas no significant alterations were observed in other brain areas studied. Microautoradiography and immunocytochemistry studies suggest that the MT-I expression is predominantly localized to astrocytes throughout the cerebrum and especially in Bergman glia in the cerebellum. However, a significant expression was also observed in microglia of the GFAP-IL6 mice. MT-III expression was significantly increased in the Purkinje cell layer and basal nuclei of the cerebellum, which was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA and by ELISA of the MT-III protein. In contrast, in the G36 but not G16 mice, transgene expression of IL-6 was associated with significantly decreased MT-III RNA levels in the dentate gyrus and CA3 pyramidal neuron layer of the hippocampus and, in both G36 and G16 mice, in the occipital but not frontal cortex and in ependymal cells. Thus, both the widely expressed MT-I isoform and the CNS specific MT-III isoform are significantly affected in a MT isoform- and CNS area-specific manner in the GFAP-IL6 mice, a chronic model of brain damage.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has a number of biologic activities, including pronounced effects on the nervous and neuroendocrine systems. In this study, in situ histochemical techniques were used to investigate the distribution of cells expressing type I IL-1 receptor mRNA in the CNS, pituitary, and adrenal gland of the mouse. Hybridization of 35S-labeled antisense cRNA probes derived from a murine T-cell IL-1 receptor cDNA revealed a distinct regional distribution of the type I IL-1 receptor, both in brain and in the pituitary gland. In the brain, an intense signal was observed over the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, over the entire midline raphe system, over the choroid plexus, and over endothelial cells of postcapillary venules throughout the neuraxis. A weak to moderate signal was observed over the pyramidal cell layer of the hilus and CA3 region of the hippocampus, over the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, over Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex, and in scattered clusters over the external-most layer of the median eminence. In the pituitary gland, a dense and homogeneously distributed signal was observed over the entire anterior lobe. No autoradiographic signal above background was observed over the posterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary, or over the adrenal gland. This study therefore provides evidence for discrete receptor substrates subserving the central effects of IL-1, thus supporting the notion that IL-1 acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in brain. It also supports studies suggesting that IL-1-mediated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurs primarily at the level of the brain and/or pituitary gland.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The developmental changes in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor properties in rat hippocampus were evaluated with quantitative autoradiography of ligand binding and in situ hybridization performed in adjacent sections with antisense oligonucleotides for AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1-3, flip and flop splice variants). Specific 3H-AMPA binding in different hippocampal subfields increased between postnatal day 7 and 15 and was higher in CA3 during the postnatal period when compared to adult levels. This effect was mostly due to high levels of high affinity binding sites in cell body layers during the developmental period. By contrast, autoradiograms of 3H-AMPA binding predominantly to the low affinity binding sites indicated an absence of these sites in cell body layers and the overall levels of binding exhibited little overshoot compared to adult levels during the developmental period. The changes in binding of the antagonist of the AMPA receptor, 6-nitro-7-cyanoquinoxaline-2,3-dione were markedly different from those for the high affinity AMPA binding sites but quite similar to those for the low affinity sites. The binding was extremely low at postnatal day 7 and increased rapidly between postnatal day 7 and 15 and slowly between postnatal day 15 and adult. Low levels of binding were observed in the cell body layer at every postnatal age. The changes in expression of messenger RNAs for the different subunits of the AMPA receptors were well correlated with the modifications in high affinity AMPA binding sites measured in the cell body layers also exhibiting an increased expression of the receptors at the transcriptional level during the developmental period as compared to adult levels. The relative expression of the GluR2 subunits decreased during the postnatal period and the time course for this reduction paralleled that for the increased vulnerability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to a variety of insults. The results indicate that both the messenger RNAs for the subunits and the AMPA receptors exhibit increased levels of expression during the postnatal period compared to adult levels. They also suggest that nascent receptors might bind AMPA with high affinity before their insertion in membranes into functional receptors that have low affinity for agonists and high affinity for antagonists. The changes in subunit composition of the receptors during the postnatal period may have important implications for mechanisms of plasticity as well as of neuropathology.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Cells that Express Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor mRNA in the Developing Postnatal Rat Brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of a family of related neurotrophic proteins which includes nerve growth factor (NGF) and hippocampus-derived neurotrophic factor/neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). To obtain information regarding possible roles for BDNF during postnatal brain development, we have examined the temporal and spatial expression of this trophic factor using in situ hybridization. In specific neocortical regions BDNF mRNA-expressing cells were seen at 2 weeks of age and thereafter. One particular neuronal cell type strikingly labelled was the inverted pyramidal cell population in the deep layers of parietotemporal cortex. In pyriform and cingulate cortices, BDNF mRNA was detected at postnatal day 1 and 1 week of age, respectively, with increasing levels during ontogeny. Several forebrain regions, including the thalamic anterior paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus as well as the preoptic area, contained moderate levels of BDNF mRNA throughout development. BDNF mRNA was detected transiently in several brainstem structures, notably in the substantia nigra and interpeduncular nucleus. Expression of this trophic factor in hippocampus was relatively low in the early neonatal brain, but attained high levels in the CA3 and CA4 regions as well as in the dentate gyrus by 2 weeks of age. At this early age, which is still during the period of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, labelling was restricted to the outer layer, which contained cells with a more mature appearance. However, by 3 weeks of age labelling was distributed throughout the granule cell layer. Our results show both transient and persistent expression of BDNF mRNA in various regions of the developing rat brain and suggest that there is a caudal to rostral gradient of BDNF expression during postnatal brain development, which may be correlated to neuronal maturation.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'AMPA-type glutamate receptors--nonselective cation channels mediating fast excitatory transmission in the CNS.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In recent years, considerable progress in our understanding of the molecular events underlying excitatory synaptic transmission has been made. This progress was mainly achieved by technical advances, among them the patch-clamp technique in brain slices (Edwards et al., 1989), fast application of agonists (Franke et al., 1987), and cloning and functional expression of GluR channels of the nonNMDA type (e.g., Hollmann et al., 1989). A suitable model for studying excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the brain slice with patch-clamp techniques is the mossy fiber synapse on CA3 pyramidal cells of rat hippocampus (MF-CA3 synapse). This synapse is located close to the cell soma and should provide almost ideal space-clamp conditions. A comparison of MF-CA3 EPSCs with the currents activated by fast application of glutamate on membrane patches isolated from CA3 cell somata suggests that the concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft during excitatory synaptic transmission is high (about 1 mM) and that the transmitter remains in the synaptic cleft only briefly (about 1 ms). It seems likely that desensitization influences the peak amplitude of the EPSC in several ways. Brief pulses of glutamate cause desensitization, from which the glutamate receptor channels recover only slowly, and micromolar ambient glutamate concentrations produce desensitization at equilibrium. From the functional properties of recombinant GluR channels, in situ hybridization data, and patch-clamp experiments on different neuronal and nonneuronal cell types, a picture of the molecular identity of native channels emerges. In neurons of the hippocampus the pharmacological features of these channels were similar to recombinant channels assembled from subunits of the AMPA/kainate subtype which are strongly expressed in these cells. The native channels are characterized by outward rectification of the steady-state I-V and low Ca permeability, similar to recombinant channels containing the GluR-B subunit. This is consistent with the ubiquitous expression of this subunit in hippocampal neurones. In contrast, GluR channels from cerebellar glial cells, which uniquely in the central nervous system lack the expression of GluR-B subunits, show double rectification and high Ca permeability. The results suggest that the native functional nonNMDA glutamate receptor channels in the CNS are assembled form subunits of the AMPA/kainate subtype in a cell-specific way, with the functional properties of GluR channels in neurones being dominated by the GluR-B subunit.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have recently reported an increase in the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in mice neonatally exposed to a persistent environmental agent, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and a subsequent exposure as adults to nonpersistent toxicants, such as bioallethrin or paraoxon. Here we have examined the effects of an exposure like this on muscarinic receptor mRNA expression. Ten-day-old Naval Medical Research Institute mice received a single oral dose of DDT (0.5 mg/kg body weight). When aged 5 months, they received bioallethrin (0.7 mg/kg body weight per day for 7 days) or paraoxon (1.4 mg/kg body weight every second day for 7 days). mRNA expression of subtypes m1, m3, and m4 was studied in 7-month-old animals. Changes could only be discovered in the DDT-bioallethrin treated mice, where expression of subtype m4 was elevated in cortex and caudate putamen. Moreover, the expression pattern of the subtypes m1, m3, and m4 in mouse brains was found to be very similar to that seen in rats, except for slight differences in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, where the outermost part of the CA3 region did not show any m4 hybridization. The present study indicates that the earlier observed increase in muscarinic receptor density in mice exposed as neonates to DDT and as adults to bioallethrin can be attributed to changes in the expression of m4.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"In situ hybridization probes selective for presenilin-2 (PS-2) were used to determine the regional and cellular expression pattern of PS-2 mRNA in rat and human brain. In rat brain, the greatest expression of PS-2 mRNA is in the granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus and cerebellum. Molecular layers within these structures are virtually devoid of signal. Cortical expression of PS-2 message is restricted to neuronal layers, while the hybridization signal is weak or absent in molecular layers and white matter. Kidney, liver, and spleen display moderate levels of PS-2 message. A PS-2 sense strand probe produced no specific signals in any tissue. In human brain, the greatest hybridization signal for PS-2 is present in the granule cells of the cerebellum. Within hippocampus, the granule cell layer of dentate is strongly labeled, with CA3 pyramidal neurons also clearly visible. A laminar expression pattern is seen in the neuronal layers of human frontal and temporal cortex, with the deeper laminae having the strongest signals. These data are consistent with a primarily neuronal localization of PS-2 mRNA within the brains of both rat and human. Within the limitations of the analysis, it appears that virtually every neuron is labeled, and differences in the intensity of labeling are associated with both neuron size/density and brain region. The distribution of PS-2 RNA is not restricted to those regions having the greatest pathology in Alzheimer's disease. However, one unusual pathological feature of PS-2 mutations causing AD is the presence of cerebellar amyloid plaques in some cases. It is intriguing, in this context, that PS-2 RNA is enriched in the cerebellum, especially in human specimens.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Nurr1 mRNA expression in neonatal and adult rat brain following kainic acid-induced seizure activity.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Nurr1 is an immediate early gene encoding a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor family. In PC12 cells, Nurr1 is readily induced by membrane depolarization, but not by growth factors. Nurr1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, and is essential to the differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. However, Nurr1 is also expressed in brain regions unrelated to dopaminergic neurons, e.g., hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and its immediate induction following seizure activity suggests a potential involvement of this transcription factor in modulating gene expression in the nervous system. To investigate the response of Nurr1 to neuronal activation, we analyzed Nurr1 mRNA expression in neonatal and adult rat brain following kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure. In P7 animals, systemic injection of KA increased Nurr1 mRNA levels in a few hilar cells of the dentate gyrus and some pyramidal cells of the CA3 region of the hippocampus. In older animals, Nurr1 induction progressively expanded to all hippocampal regions (P14, P21) and eventually to cortical regions (adult). The increase was rapid and transient in the dentate gyrus, a structure resistant to the neurotoxic effect of KA, and was more prolonged in other regions more susceptible to KA toxicity. Induction of Nurr1 at early postnatal stages and rapid increase in the dentate gyrus following KA-induced seizure, suggest that Nurr1 expression is modulated by neuronal activity. On the other hand, prolonged Nurr1 induction in regions sensitive to KA toxicity indicates a possible involvement of Nurr1 in selective neuronal vulnerability.',\n",

BSPL lacks, however, the catalytic residue responsible for peptidase activity. The expression of BSPL is widespread throughout the CNS but restricted to neurons under normal conditions. Twenty-four hours after injection of kainic acid into the hippocampus, a dramatic increase in the concentration of BSPL mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the CA3 region of the injected hemisphere as compared with the contralateral hemisphere or sham-injected animals. An increase in the steady-state level of BSPL mRNA concentration was also found following tetanic stimulation of the perforant path to produce LTP in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Hybridization signals could be detected in dendritic processes of pyramidal neurons and in some glial cells upon either type of stimulation.

       "  'Abstract': \"The cellular and intracellular localization of the epsilon-subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC) in the rat brain was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies against epsilon-PKC. The epsilon-PKC-specific immunoreactivity was most abundant in the hippocampal formation, olfactory tubercle and Calleja's islands, was moderate in the cerebral cortex, anterior olfactory nuclei, accumbens nucleus, lateral septal nuclei and caudate-putamen and low in the thalamus and medulla. The epsilon-PKC-immunoreactivity was scanty in the perikarya, except for the pyramidal cells of CA3 region of the hippocampus and the immunoreactivity was mainly present in neuropils and nerve fibers. The distribution of epsilon-PKC immunoreactive neurons was consistent with that obtained by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Electron microscopic observations of the hippocampus revealed that the epsilon-PKC is predominantly present in the cytoplasm of axon and nerve terminals and that this enzyme is associated with mitochondrial membrane and vesicles. These results suggested that epsilon-PKC is probably involved in presynaptic functions in CNS, perhaps even neurotransmitter release.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuronal degeneration has been shown to be involved in various neurological disorders. Growth/trophic factors and their receptors are known to be important for the regeneration and survival of neurons. We report here the molecular cloning of a receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase, bsk, (for brain specific kinase). Bsk is highly related to the eph/elk receptor-like kinase family members. Northern blot analysis shows that it is expressed specifically in the brain, with no expression detected in adult heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In situ hybridization analysis of adult mouse brain sections indicates that bsk is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus, tenia tecta, indusium griseum, and the piriform cortex, major components of the limbic system that are important for learning and memory. In addition, elevated levels of expression are found in other areas of the limbic system such as the amygdala, medial septum, and nucleus of the diagonal band, and in the olfactory bulb, which has close connections to the limbic system. The highest level of expression is found in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the pyramidal cell layer of the piriform cortex. In 16.5 day mouse embryos, bsk is expressed predominantly in the primordial cortex of the telencephalon. An antibody against a C-terminal peptide of bsk recognized a 105 kD protein in the 16.5 day embryonic head extract. Our analysis shows that bsk is a growth factor receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase and that its greatest expression in the adult brain is associated with components of the limbic system.',\n",

To further explore this hypothesis, we compared the neuroanatomical pattern of BDNF mRNA and protein in response to electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) or kainic acid-induced seizure activity. Using in situ hybridization, we found that chronic ECS induced BDNF mRNA predominantly in the granule neurons of the dentate gyrus. However, immunohistochemistry with an anti-BDNF antibody revealed that ECS increased endogenous BDNF protein in the mossy fibers, which are composed of axons projecting from the granule neurons of the dentate gyrus to the CA3 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. Kainic acid administration (10 mg/kg, i.p., once) was used to lesion CA3 neurons selectively, as these are a possible retrograde source of BDNF protein in mossy fibers. Three weeks later, a prolonged elevation of BDNF mRNA in granule neurons, but not elsewhere in hippocampus, was accompanied by an increase in BDNF protein in the mossy fibers. These results suggest that BDNF was transcribed and translated in granule neuron cell bodies but transported in an anterograde direction to provide trophic support of CA3 pyramidal neurons.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Selective early induction of synaptosomal-associated protein (molecular weight 25,000) following systemic administration of kainate at convulsant doses in the rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of mol. wt 25,000) is an essential component for neurotransmitter release, and its expression has been related to the plastic responses that follow CNS injury. In the present study, transient induction of SNAP-25 in selected brain areas is shown by immunohistochemistry at short times after a single intraperitoneal injection of kainate at convulsant doses. Six hours after kainate injection, SNAP-25 immunoreactivity was noticed in the perikarya of certain neurons of the perirhinal and lateral cortices, polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, CA3 pyramidal area of the hippocampus, and thalamus. In the same areas, a strong increase in SNAP-25 immunorectivity was detected at 12 and 24 h after kainate injection in cell bodies and fibers. Four days after kainate administration, the immunostaining pattern was similar to that observed in control animals. Intraperitoneal injection of cycloheximide blocked the expression of SNAP-25, thus suggesting de novo SNAP-25 protein synthesis following kainate administration. Kainate-dependent induction of SNAP-25a messenger RNA synthesis was observed by in situ hybridization in the mentioned brain areas. Heat shock protein of mol. wt 72,000 (HSP70/72) is a chaperone whose expression is induced early under stress conditions. Its expression and distribution were compared to that of SNAP-25 after the excitotoxic insult. Brain areas overexpressing SNAP-25 and HSP70/72 overlapped. In addition, partial co-localization of both antigens was observed by double-labeling immunohistochemistry. These results provide evidence of an involvement of SNAP-25 in the reactive response that follows kainate administration, and support the role of this protein in the plastic events that take place after kainate excitotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Plasminogen (Plg), which can be converted to the active protease plasmin by plasminogen activators, has been previously implicated in brain plasticity and in toxicity inflicted in hippocampal pyramidal neurons by kainate. Here we have localized Plg. mRNA through in situ hybridization in brain cryosections derived from normal adult mice or after kainate injection (i.p.). The results indicated that Plg mRNA was undetectable in the normal brain, but after kainate injection it was induced in neuronal cells in multiple, but specific areas, including layers II-III of the neocortex; the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and the piriform cortex; the caudate/putamen and accumbens nucleus shell; throughout the amygdaloid complex; and in the CAI/CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Interestingly, this distribution pattern coincided with what we have recently described for the plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) mRNA, however differing from that of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mRNA, as also shown here. These results suggest that enhanced Plg gene expression could be involved in events associated with olfactory, striatal, and limbic structures. Furthermore, because PAI-2 is thought to intracellularly counteract cytotoxic events, our results raise the possibility that PAI-2 can act in the brain as an intracellular neuroprotector against potential plasmin-mediated toxicity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'There is strong evidence that ATP acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the periphery, yet little is known about fast central ATP-mediated transmission. We report here the molecular cloning of a novel neuronal ionotropic ATP receptor of the P2x subtype (P2x3) isolated from rat brain. This central P2x channel subunit has significant amino acid homology with two recently cloned ATP-gated channels from rat smooth muscle (47%) and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (37%). P2x3 receptor contains the characteristic 10 conserved cysteines of ATP-gated channels, a putative extracellular region homologous to the Walker type A motif found in various nucleotide-binding proteins, and two potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Homomeric receptor P2x3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes produce rapid cation-selective purinergic currents that are potentiated by zinc ions and reversibly blocked by the P2x antagonists suramin, Reactive Blue 2, and pyridoxalphosphate-6-axophenyl-2U,4U-disulfonic acid. P2x3-receptor subunit mRNA is found in the Purkinje cells and the granule cells of the cerebellum as well as in CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus that are innervated by zinc-rich axon terminals of mossy fibers. Our results suggest that fast excitatory synaptic transmission mediated by zinc-sensitive ATP-gated channels is widespread in mammalian brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the key intermediate in the gene expression pathway. The amount of mRNA in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains has been determined using in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) to detect the poly(A) tails of polyadenylated mRNA (poly(A) + mRNA). On a regional basis, AD cases had significantly less poly(A) + mRNA than controls in hippocampus (field CA3) and cerebellum (granule cell layer). Analysis of constituent pyramidal neurons showed mean reductions per cell within AD hippocampus (field CA3) and temporal cortex, but not in visual cortex. Similar changes were seen in a small group of non-AD dementias. The finding of reduced poly(A) + mRNA content is another indication of the altered brain gene expression occurring in AD. It is proposed that measurement of poly(A) + mRNA may be valuable in identifying functionally impaired neuronal populations. The methodology also provides a means by which changes in the quantitative distribution of individual mRNAs can be determined relative to that of poly(A) + mRNA as a whole.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Seizures have been shown to regulate neurotrophin expression in adult mammalian brain. However, there has been some controversy as to whether seizures affect neurotrophin expression in very immature brain. In the present study, we have examined the effects of seizures induced by pilocarpine following lithium pretreatment or by kainic acid on the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in developing rat brain by in situ hybridization. In adult brain, lithium/pilocarpine treatment resulted in dramatic elevations of hybridization to BDNF cRNA in neocortical and limbic brain structures. In developing brain, lithium/pilocarpine induced elevations of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus, piriform and entorhinal cortex as early as postnatal day 7 (P7). By P12, the pattern of enhanced expression was similar to that of the adult. Maximal elevations of hybridization were present 2 to 4 h following pilocarpine injection. Electrophysiological recording demonstrated that lithium/pilocarpine treatment resulted in electrographic seizures. Pretreatment with diazepam blocked the seizures as well as the elevation of BDNF mRNA. Kainic acid induced elevations of BDNF mRNA in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer, but not in other brain areas in pups as young as P7. These data indicate that seizures during the neonatal and early juvenile period of brain development induce elevated BDNF mRNA expression, and that different methods of seizure induction yield different patterns of elevations in hybridization. Furthermore, BDNF may be capable of playing a role in the development of seizure susceptibility in the immature brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'NMDA receptors play key roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development, and may be involved in learning, memory, and compensation following injury. A polyclonal antibody that recognizes four of seven splice variants of NMDAR1 was made using a C-terminus peptide (30 amino acid residues). NMDAR1 is the major NMDA receptor subunit, found in most or all NMDA receptor complexes. On immunoblots, this antibody labeled a single major band migrating at M(r) = 120,000. The antibody did not cross-react with extracts from transfected cells expressing other glutamate receptor subunits, nor did it label non-neuronal tissues. Immunostained vibratome sections of rat tissue showed labeling in many neurons in most structures in the brain, as well as in the cervical spinal cord, dorsal root and vestibular ganglia, and in pineal and pituitary glands. Staining was moderate to dense in the olfactory bulb, neocortex, striatum, some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, the colliculi, and many reticular, sensory, and motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. The densest stained cells included the pyramidal and hilar neurons of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, supraoptic and magnocellular paraventricular neurons of the hypothalamus, inferior olive, red nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus, peripheral dorsal cochlear nucleus, and motor nuclei of the lower brainstem and spinal cord. Ultrastructural localization of immunostaining was examined in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar cortex. The major staining was in postsynaptic densities apposed by unstained presynaptic terminals with round or mainly round vesicles, and in associated dendrites. The pattern of staining matched that of previous in situ hybridization but differed somewhat from that of binding studies, implying that multiple types of NMDA receptors exist. Comparison with previous studies of localization of other glutamate receptor types revealed that NMDAR1 may colocalize with these other types in many neurons throughout the nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'VASE-containing N-CAM isoforms are increased in the hippocampus in bipolar disorder but not schizophrenia.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a cell recognition molecule that is involved in cellular migration, synaptic plasticity, and CNS development. In schizophrenia, a 105- to 115-kDa N-CAM protein is increased in CSF and in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The variable alternatively spliced exon (VASE) of N-CAM is developmentally regulated and can be spliced into any of the major 120-, 140-, and 180-kDa N-CAM isoforms. We determined that the variable alternative spliced exon of N-CAM (VASE) also is increased in bipolar disorder by quantitative Western immunoblot. VASE immunoreactive proteins (triplet bands around 140 kDa and a single band around 145 kDa) were identified in soluble and membrane brain extracts and quantified in the hippocampus. Soluble VASE 140 kDa was increased in the hippocampus of patients with bipolar disorder as compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia, and suicide cases. Membrane-extracted VASE 140 and 145 kDa were unchanged in the same groups. Multiple 145-kDa VASE-immunoreactive proteins that also reacted to an N-CAM antibody were separated by isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis followed by western immunoblotting; however, the VASE 140-kDa proteins were only weakly N-CAM immunoreactive. By immunohistochemistry, VASE colocalized with GFAP-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus. VASE immunostaining was also observed in the cytoplasm of CA4 pyramidal neurons that were positive for phosphorylated high molecular weight neurofilament and synaptophysin terminals. Thus no differences in VASE were found in patients with schizophrenia, but there was a marked increase of VASE immunoreactive proteins in bipolar disorder. It is possible that abnormal regulation of N-CAM proteins results in differing patterns of abnormal expression in neuropsychiatric disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The plasticity-related protein Synaptopodin (SP) has been implicated in neuronal plasticity. SP is targeted to dendritic spines and the axon initial segment, where it organizes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the spine apparatus and the cisternal organelle, respectively. Here, we report an inducible third localization of SP in the somata of activated granule cell ensembles in mouse dentate gyrus. Using immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we observed a subpopulation of mature granule cells (~1-2%) exhibiting perinuclear SP protein and a strong somatic SP mRNA signal. Double immunofluorescence labeling for Arc demonstrated that ~\\u200975% of these somatic SP-positive cells are also Arc-positive. Placement of mice into a novel environment caused a rapid (~2-4\\xa0h) induction of Arc, SP mRNA, and SP protein in exploration-induced granule cell ensembles. Lesion experiments showed that this induction requires input from the entorhinal cortex. Somatic SP colocalized with α-Actinin2, a known binding partner of SP. Finally, ultrastructural analysis revealed SP immunoprecipitate on dense plates linking cytoplasmic and perinuclear ER cisterns; these structures were absent in granule cells of SP-deficient mice. Our data implicate SP in the formation of contextual representations in the dentate gyrus and the behaviorally induced reorganization of cytoplasmic and perinuclear ER.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus is characterized by the presence of life-long neurogenesis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism regulating hippocampal neurogenesis, we studied the functions of the chemorepellent Draxin in neuronal proliferation and differentiation in the postnatal dentate gyrus. The present in vivo cell labeling and fate tracking analyses revealed enhanced differentiation of hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells (hNSPCs) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of Draxin-deficient mice. We observed a reduction in the number of BrdU-pulse labeled or Ki-67 immunopositive SGZ cells in the mutant mice. However, Draxin deficiency did not affect cell cycle duration of SGZ cells. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that the receptor component of the canonical Wnt pathway, Lrp6, is expressed in SGZ cells, including Nestin and Sox2 double-positive hNSPCs. Taken together with the previous finding that Draxin interacts physically with Lrp6, we postulate that Draxin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Wnt-driven hNSPC differentiation to modulate the rate of neuronal differentiation in the progenitor population.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We recently demonstrated that granule cells located in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) are activated by neurons located in the lateral supramammillary nucleus (SumL) during paradoxical sleep (PS) hypersomnia. To determine whether these neurons are glutamatergic and/or GABAergic, we combined FOS immunostaining with in situ hybridization of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGLUT2, a marker of glutamatergic neurons) or that of the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT, a marker of GABAergic neurons) mRNA in rats displaying PS hypersomnia (PSR). We found that 84 and 76\\xa0% of the FOS+\\xa0SumL neurons in PSR rats expressed vGLUT2 and vGAT mRNA, respectively. Then, we examined vGLUT2 and FOS immunostaining in the dorsal and ventral DG of PSR rats with a neurochemical lesion of the Sum. In PSR-lesioned animals but not in sham animals, nearly all vGLUT2+\\xa0fibers and FOS+\\xa0neurons disappeared in the dDG, but not in the ventral DG (vDG). To identify the pathway (s) responsible (s) for the activation of the vDG during PS hypersomnia, we combined Fluorogold (FG) injection in the vDG of PSR rats with FOS staining. We found a large number of neurons FOS-FG+, specifically in the medial entorhinal cortex (ENTm). Altogether, our results suggest that SumL neurons with a unique dual glutamatergic and GABAergic phenotype are responsible for the activation of the dDG during PS hypersomnia, while vDG granule neurons are activated by ENTm cortical neurons. These results suggest differential mechanisms and functions for the activation of the dDG and the vDG granule cells during PS.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distinctive population of Gfap-expressing neural progenitors arising around the dentate notch migrate and form the granule cell layer in the developing hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In the adult hippocampus, granule cells continue to be generated from astrocyte-like progenitors expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) that differ from embryonic neocortical progenitors. However, during the embryonic period, dentate granule neurons and neocortical pyramidal neurons are derived from the ventricular zone (VZ) of the pallium. Our question is when do GFAP+ progenitors of granule neurons appear in the developing hippocampus during the embryonic period, and how do they form the granule cell layer. The present analysis using Gfap-GFP transgenic mice shows that the GFP+ distinct cell population first appears in the VZ of the medial pallium at the dorsal edge of the fimbria on embryonic day 13.5. During the perinatal period, they form a migratory stream from the VZ to the developing dentate gyrus, and establish the germinal zones in the migratory stream, and the marginal and hilar regions in the developing dentate gyrus. GFP+ cells in these regions were positive for Sox2 and Ki67, but negative for BLBP. GFP+ cells with Neurogenin2 expression were largely distributed in the VZ, whereas GFP+ cells with Tbr2 and NeuroD expressions were seen in the migratory stream and developing dentate gyrus. Prox1-expressing GFP+ cells were restricted to the developing dentate gyrus. These results suggest that distinctive Gfap-expressing progenitors arising around the dentate notch form germinal regions in the migratory stream and the developing dentate gyrus where they differentiate into granule neurons, indicating that distinct astrocyte-like neural progenitors continue to generate granule neurons, from the beginning of dentate development and throughout life.

       "  'Abstract': 'Several studies suggest that neurons from the lateral region of the SuM (SuML) innervating the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) display a dual GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission and are specifically activated during paradoxical (REM) sleep (PS). The objective of the present study is to characterize the anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of the SuML-DG projection neurons and to determine how they control DG oscillations and neuronal activation during PS and other vigilance states. For this purpose, we combine structural connectivity techniques using neurotropic viral vectors (rabies virus, AAV), neurochemical anatomy (immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization) and imaging (light, electron and confocal microscopy) with in vitro (patch clamp) and in vivo (LFP, EEG) optogenetic and electrophysiological recordings performed in transgenic VGLUT2-cre male mice. At the cellular level, we show that the SuML-DG neurons co-release GABA and glutamate on dentate granule cells and increase the activity of a subset of DG granule cells. At the network level, we show that activation of the SuML-DG pathway increases theta power and frequency during PS as well as gamma power during PS and waking in the DG. At the behavioral level, we show that the activation of this pathway does not change animal behavior during PS, induces awakening during slow wave sleep and increases motor activity during waking. These results suggest that the SuML-DG pathway is capable of supporting the increase of theta and gamma power in the DG observed during PS and plays an important modulatory role of DG network activity during this state.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Epilepsy occurs in one of 26 people. Temporal lobe epilepsy is common and can be difficult to treat effectively. It can develop after brain injuries that damage the hippocampus. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms involving the hippocampal dentate gyrus have been proposed. This study evaluated a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy to test which pathological changes in the dentate gyrus correlate with seizure frequency and help prioritize potential mechanisms for further study. FVB mice (n\\u2009=\\u2009127) that had experienced status epilepticus after systemic treatment with pilocarpine 31-61 days earlier were video-monitored for spontaneous, convulsive seizures 9 hr/day every day for 24-36 days. Over 4,060 seizures were observed. Seizure frequency ranged from an average of one every 3.6 days to one every 2.1 hr. Hippocampal sections were processed for Nissl stain, Prox1-immunocytochemistry, GluR2-immunocytochemistry, Timm stain, glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunocytochemistry, glutamic acid decarboxylase in situ hybridization, and parvalbumin-immunocytochemistry. Stereological methods were used to measure hilar ectopic granule cells, mossy cells, mossy fiber sprouting, astrogliosis, and GABAergic interneurons. Seizure frequency was not significantly correlated with the generation of hilar ectopic granule cells, the number of mossy cells, the extent of mossy fiber sprouting, the extent of astrogliosis, or the number of GABAergic interneurons in the molecular layer or hilus. Seizure frequency significantly correlated with the loss of GABAergic interneurons in or adjacent to the granule cell layer, but not with the loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons. These findings prioritize the loss of granule cell layer interneurons for further testing as a potential cause of temporal lobe epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Sleep loss disrupts Arc expression in dentate gyrus neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Sleep loss affects many aspects of cognition, and memory consolidation processes occurring in the hippocampus seem particularly vulnerable to sleep loss. The immediate-early gene Arc plays an essential role in both synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and its expression is altered by sleep. Here, using a variety of techniques, we have characterized the effects of brief (3-h) periods of sleep vs. sleep deprivation (SD) on the expression of Arc mRNA and Arc protein in the mouse hippocampus and cortex. By comparing the relative abundance of mature Arc mRNA with unspliced pre-mRNA, we see evidence that during SD, increases in Arc across the cortex, but not hippocampus, reflect de novo transcription. Arc increases in the hippocampus during SD are not accompanied by changes in pre-mRNA levels, suggesting that increases in mRNA stability, not transcription, drives this change. Using in situ hybridization (together with behavioral observation to quantify sleep amounts), we find that in the dorsal hippocampus, SD minimally affects Arc mRNA expression, and decreases the number of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells expressing Arc. This is in contrast to neighboring cortical areas, which show large increases in neuronal Arc expression after SD. Using immunohistochemistry, we find that Arc protein expression is also differentially affected in the cortex and DG with SD - while larger numbers of cortical neurons are Arc+, fewer DG granule cells are Arc+, relative to the same regions in sleeping mice. These data suggest that with regard to expression of plasticity-regulating genes, sleep (and SD) can have differential effects in hippocampal and cortical areas. This may provide a clue regarding the susceptibility of performance on hippocampus-dependent tasks to deficits following even brief periods of sleep loss.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Deletion of the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) enhances excitatory synaptic transmission, reduces network inhibition but does not impair synaptic plasticity in the mouse dentate gyrus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) is a transmembrane synaptic protein belonging to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene family. Although the role of this gene family-in particular of APP-has been intensely studied in the context of Alzheimer's disease, the physiological roles of its family members remain poorly understood. In particular, the function of APLP1, which is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, has remained enigmatic. Since APP has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, we wondered whether APLP1 could play a similar role. First, using in situ hybridization and laser microdissection combined with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we observed that Aplp1 mRNA is highly expressed in dentate granule cells. Having this examined, we studied synaptic plasticity at the perforant path-granule cell synapses in the dentate gyrus of APLP1-deficient mice in vivo. Analysis of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of perforant path fibers revealed increased excitatory transmission in APLP1-deficient mice. Moreover, we observed decreased paired-pulse inhibition of population spikes indicating a decrease in network inhibition upon deletion of APLP1. In contrast, short-term presynaptic plasticity (STP) as well as long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP) was unchanged in the absence of APLP1. Based on these results we conclude that APLP1 deficiency on its own does not lead to defects in synaptic plasticity, but affects synaptic transmission and network inhibition in the dentate gyrus.\",\n",

We sought to identify all RNA transcripts that localize to the distal dendrites of dentate gyrus granule cells following unilateral high frequency stimulation of the perforant pathway (pp-HFS) using Sprague Dawley rats. We then utilized laser microdissection (LMD) to very accurately dissect out the distal 2/3rds of the molecular layer (ML), which contains these dendrites, without contamination from the granule cell layer, 2 and 4 h post pp-HFS. Next, we purified and amplified RNA from the ML and performed an unbiased screen for 27,000 RNA transcripts using Affymetrix microarrays. We determined that Activity Regulated Cytoskeletal Protein (Arc/Arg3.1) mRNA, exhibited the greatest fold increase in the ML at both timepoints (2 and 4 h). In total, we identified 31 transcripts that increased their levels within the ML following pp-HFS across the two timepoints.

       "  'Abstract': \"The hyperpolarization-activated cation current I(h) is an important regulator of neuronal excitability and may contribute to the properties of the dentate gyrus granule (DGG) cells, which constitute the input site of the canonical hippocampal circuit. Here, we investigated changes in I(h) in DGG cells in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the rat pilocarpine model of TLE using the patch-clamp technique. Messenger-RNA (mRNA) expression of I(h)-conducting HCN1, 2 and 4 isoforms was determined using semi-quantitative in-situ hybridization. I(h) density was ∼1.8-fold greater in DGG cells of TLE patients with Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) as compared to patients without AHS. The magnitude of somatodendritic I(h) was enhanced also in DGG cells in epileptic rats, most robustly during the latent phase after status epilepticus and prior to the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures. During the chronic phase, I(h) was increased ∼1.7-fold. This increase of I(h) was paralleled by an increase in HCN1 and HCN4 mRNA expression, whereas HCN2 expression was unchanged. Our data demonstrate an epilepsy-associated upregulation of I(h) likely due to increased HCN1 and HCN4 expression, which indicate plasticity of I(h) during epileptogenesis and which may contribute to a compensatory decrease in neuronal excitability of DGG cells.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Studies on the role of 17β-estradiol (E2) in the hippocampus have mainly focused on CA1 and CA3 regions, whereas in dentate gyrus (DG), its role is largely unknown. Here, we examined potential functions of E2 in DG, particularly during development. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed abundance of estrogen receptor (ER)α, but not ERβ, expression in DG. Similar to CA1, analysis of synapse densities revealed a reduction in spine synapse number in DG molecular layer of immature rats and adult mice after inhibition of estradiol synthesis using letrozole. Interestingly, strong expression of ERα was found in Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells, which regulate neuronal migration and synaptogenesis via the extracellular matrix protein reelin. Immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, was strongest in mature granule cells. In hippocampal slice cultures, exogenous application of E2 caused an increase in reelin expression in CR cells, which was abolished after blockade of ERs using ICI182,780. Vice versa, inhibition of aromatase activity by letrozole resulted in reduced reelin expression, suggesting that E2 deriving from hippocampal sources contributes to the regulation of reelin as well as to the maintenance of spine synapses in DG. E2 further regulated Notch1, a signaling protein involved in neuronal differentiation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus provide a constant supply of neuronal precursors, yet only a small fraction of these cells survive and develop into mature dentate granule cells (DGCs). A major challenge of current research is thus to understand the stringent selection process that governs the maturation and functional integration of adult-born DGCs. In mature DGCs, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the perforant path input elicits robust expression of the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1, trafficking of its mRNA to dendrites, and local synthesis of the protein necessary for consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP). Given the synaptic commitment inherent in LTP consolidation, we considered that HFS-evoked expression of Arc could be used to timemap the functional integration of newborn DGCs. Dividing cells were birthmarked by BrdU-labeling at 1, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days prior to induction of LTP and expression of Arc was examined by confocal microscopy. Contrary to expectation, LTP did not induce Arc expression in newborn cells at any age, suggesting they might be refractory to synaptically-evoked Arc expression for at least one month. Importantly, however, spontaneous expression of Arc was detected in BrdU-labeled cells and strongly associated with the survival and maturation of NeuN-positive DGCs. Moreover, Arc expression at the earliest ages (1 and 7 days), clearly precedes the formation of glutamatergic synapses on new neurons. These results suggest an unexpected early role for Arc in adult-born DGCs, distinct from its functions in LTP, LTD, and homeostatic synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) are thought to disambiguate similar experiences--a process termed pattern separation. Using zif268 as a marker of cellular activity, DG function was assessed in rats performing two tasks: a place task (go east) and a response task (turn right). As these tasks occurred within the same physical space (a plus maze) without any physical cue to indicate the correct strategy in a given trial, this scenario critically involves disambiguation of task demands and presumably pattern separation. Performance of the two tasks induced zif268 expression in distinct populations of granule cells within the suprapyramidal but not the infrapyramidal blade of the DG. Repeated performance of the same task (i.e., two response-task trials or two place-task trials), however, elicited zif268 expression within a single subset of the granule cell population. This differential transcription pattern shows that the retrieval of different behavioral strategies or mnemonic demands recruit distinct ensembles of granule cells, possibly to prevent interference between memories of events occurring within the same physical space to permit the selection of appropriate responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously found that the dendritic trees of dentate gyrus granule cells are selectively vulnerable to food restriction but there are reorganizational morphological events that minimize functional impairments. As the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the cognate receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) are involved in the maintenance of the structure of dendritic trees, we thought of interest to verify if there are alterations in its synthesis and expression in granule cells. To investigate this issue, 2-month-old rats were submitted to 40% caloric restriction for 6 months and compared to controls fed ad libitum. The numbers of granule cells containing BDNF and TrkB proteins were estimated from immunostained sections and the respective mRNA levels of individual neurons evaluated using nonradioactive in situ hybridization. After dietary treatment there was a 15% reduction of BDNF-immunoreactive granule cells with no changes of the number of TrkB-immunostained neurons. No alterations were found in the levels of BDNF and TrkB mRNAs of individual granule cells. As caloric restriction extends the lifespan of animals, the restrictive dietary regimens are generally regarded as beneficial to the organisms, but the present results suggest that caution is needed when extrapolating to some neuronal populations.',\n",

In this study, we characterized the expression of HuD and GAP-43 mRNA in the hippocampus during two forms of neuronal plasticity. During post-natal development, maximal expression of both molecules was found at P5 and their levels steadily decreased thereafter. At P5, HuD was also present in the subventricular zone, where it co-localized with doublecortin. In the adult hippocampus, the basal levels of HuD and GAP-43 were lower than during development but were significantly increased in the dentate gyrus after seizures. The function of HuD in GAP-43 gene expression was confirmed using HuD-KO mice, in which the GAP-43 mRNA was significantly less stable than in wild type mice. Altogether, these results demonstrate that HuD plays a role in the post-transcriptional control of GAP-43 mRNA in dentate granule cells during developmental and adult plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single-cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding biological systems. Using an in\\xa0situ 3D multiplexed imaging method, seqFISH, we identify unique transcriptional states by quantifying and clustering up to 249 genes in 16,958 cells to examine whether the hippocampus is organized into transcriptionally distinct subregions. We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states. In addition, we found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. These structures and patterns are observed using different mice and different sets of genes. Together, these results demonstrate the power of seqFISH in transcriptional profiling of complex tissues.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Temporal lobe epilepsy is often associated with pathological changes in the dentate gyrus, and such changes may be more common in humans than in some nonprimate species. To examine species-specific characteristics that might predispose the dentate gyrus to epileptogenic damage, we evaluated recurrent excitation of granule cells with and without basal dendrites in macaque monkeys, measured miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) of granule cells in macaque monkeys and compared them to rats, and estimated the granule cell-to-interneuron ratio in macaque monkeys and rats. In hippocampal slices from monkeys, whole-cell patch recording revealed antidromically evoked excitatory PSCs that were four times larger and inhibitory PSCs that were over two times larger in granule cells with basal dendrites than without. These findings suggest that granule cells with basal dendrites receive more recurrent excitation and, to a lesser degree, more recurrent inhibition. Miniature IPSC amplitude was slightly larger in monkey granule cells with basal dendrites than in those without, but mIPSC frequency was similar and only 26% of that reported for rats. In situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase and immunocytochemistry for somatostatin, parvalbumin, and neuronal nuclei revealed interneuron proportions and distributions in monkeys that were similar to those reported for rats. However, the interneuron-to-granule cell ratio was lower in monkeys (1:28) than in rats (1:11). These findings suggest that in the primate dentate gyrus, recurrent excitation is enhanced and inhibition is reduced compared with rodents. These primate characteristics may contribute to the susceptibility of the human dentate gyrus to epileptogenic injuries.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Enhanced expression of a specific hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel (HCN) in surviving dentate gyrus granule cells of human and experimental epileptic hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Changes in the expression of ion channels, contributing to altered neuronal excitability, are emerging as possible mechanisms in the development of certain human epilepsies. In previous immature rodent studies of experimental prolonged febrile seizures, isoform-specific changes in the expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (HCNs) correlated with long-lasting hippocampal hyperexcitability and enhanced seizure susceptibility. Prolonged early-life seizures commonly precede human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), suggesting that transcriptional dysregulation of HCNs might contribute to the epileptogenic process. Therefore, we determined whether HCN isoform expression was modified in hippocampi of individuals with TLE. HCN1 and HCN2 expression were measured using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry in hippocampi from three groups: TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (HS; n = 17), epileptic hippocampi without HS, or non-HS (NHS; n = 10), and autopsy material (n = 10). The results obtained in chronic human epilepsy were validated by examining hippocampi from the pilocarpine model of chronic TLE. In autopsy and most NHS hippocampi, HCN1 mRNA expression was substantial in pyramidal cell layers and lower in dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs). In contrast, HCN1 mRNA expression over the GC layer and in individual GCs from epileptic hippocampus was markedly increased once GC neuronal density was reduced by >50%. HCN1 mRNA changes were accompanied by enhanced immunoreactivity in the GC dendritic fields and more modest changes in HCN2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, similar robust and isoform-selective augmentation of HCN1 mRNA expression was evident also in the pilocarpine animal model of TLE. These findings indicate that the expression of HCN isoforms is dynamically regulated in human as well as in experimental hippocampal epilepsy. After experimental febrile seizures (i.e., early in the epileptogenic process), the preserved and augmented inhibition onto principal cells may lead to reduced HCN1 expression. In contrast, in chronic epileptic HS hippocampus studied here, the profound loss of interneuronal and principal cell populations and consequent reduced inhibition, coupled with increased dendritic excitation of surviving GCs, might provoke a \"compensatory\" enhancement of HCN1 mRNA and protein expression.',\n",

This study aims to compare the proteomes of basal and dispersed granule cells in the hippocampus of eight MTLE patients with GCD to identify proteins that may mediate GCD in MTLE. Quantitative proteomics identified 1,882 proteins, of which 29% were found in basal granule cells only, 17% in dispersed only and 54% in both samples.

       "  'Abstract': 'The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is one of a few regions in the adult mammalian brain characterized by ongoing neurogenesis. Proliferation of neural precursors in the granule cell layer of the DG has been identified in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling epilepsy model, however, little is known about the molecular mechanism. We previously reported that the expression pattern of bone morphogenetic proteins-4 (BMP4) mRNA in the hippocampus was developmentally regulated and mainly localized in the DG of the adult. To explore the role of BMP4 in epileptic activity, we detected BMP4 expression in the DG during PTZ kindling process and explore its correlation with cell proliferation combined with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling technique. We found that dynamic changes in BMP4 level and BrdU labeled cells dependent on the kindling stage of PTZ induced seizure-prone state. The number of BMP4 mRNA-positive cells and BrdU labeled cells reached the top level 1 day after PTZ kindled, then declined to base level 2 months later. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between increased BMP4 mRNA expression and increased number of BrdU labeled cells. After effectively blocked expression of BMP4 with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides(ASODN), the BrdU labeled cells in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone(DG-SGZ) and hilus were significantly decreased 16d after the first PTZ injection and 1, 3, 7, 14d after kindled respectively. These findings suggest that increased proliferation in the DG of the hippocampus resulted from kindling epilepsy elicited by PTZ maybe be modulated by BMP4 over-expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Novel spatially restricted genetic manipulations can be used to assess contributions made by synaptic plasticity to learning and memory, not just selectively within the hippocampus, but even within specific hippocampal subfields. Here we generated genetically modified mice (NR1(deltaDG) mice) exhibiting complete loss of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor specifically in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. There was no evidence of any reduction in NR1 subunit levels in any of the other hippocampal subfields, or elsewhere in the brain. NR1(deltaDG) mice displayed severely impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in both medial and lateral perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus, whereas LTP was unchanged in CA3-to-CA1 cell synapses in hippocampal slices. Behavioural assessment of NR1(deltaDG) mice revealed a spatial working memory impairment on a three-from-six radial arm maze task despite normal hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory acquisition and performance of the same task. This behavioural phenotype resembles that of NR1(deltaCA3) mice but differs from that of NR1(deltaCA1) mice which do show a spatial reference memory deficit, consistent with the idea of subfield-specific contributions to hippocampal information processing. Furthermore, this pattern of selective functional loss and sparing is the same as previously observed with the global GluR-A L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazelopropionate receptor subunit knockout, a mutation which blocks the expression of hippocampal LTP. The present results show that dissociations between spatial working memory and spatial reference memory can be induced by disrupting synaptic plasticity specifically and exclusively within the dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampal formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Interneurons of the dentate gyrus are a diverse group of neurons that use GABA as their primary neurotransmitter. Morphological studies of these neurons have been challenging since no single neuroanatomical method provides a complete view of these interneurons. However, through the integration of findings obtained from multiple methods, an interesting picture of this complex group of neurons is emerging, and this review focuses on studies in rats and mice. In situ hybridization of mRNAs for the two isoforms of the GABA synthesizing enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67), demonstrates the abundance of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus and their high concentration in the hilus and along the base of the granule cell layer. Likewise, immunohistochemical studies, particularly of GAD65, demonstrate the rich fields of GABA terminals not only around the somata of granule cells but also in the dendritic regions of the molecular layer. This broad group of GABA neurons and their terminals can be subdivided according to their morphological characteristics, including the distribution of their axonal plexus, and their neurochemical identity. Intracellular labeling of single interneurons has been instrumental in demonstrating the extensiveness of their axonal plexus and the relatively specific spatial distribution of their axonal fields. These findings have led to the broad classification of interneurons into those that terminate primarily at perisomatic regions and those that innervate the dendrites of granule cells. The interneurons also can be classified according to their neuropeptide and calcium-binding protein content. These and other molecules contribute to the rich diversity of dentate interneurons and may provide opportunities for selectively regulating specific groups of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus in order to enhance their function or protect vulnerable neurons from damage.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Long-term recognition memory requires protein synthesis, but little is known about the coordinate regulation of specific genes. Here, we examined expression of the plasticity-associated immediate early genes (Arc, Zif268, and Narp) in the dentate gyrus following long-term object-place recognition learning in rats. RT-PCR analysis from dentate gyrus tissue collected shortly after training did not reveal learning-specific changes in Arc mRNA expression. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were therefore used to assess possible sparse effects on gene expression. Learning about objects increased the density of granule cells expressing Arc, and to a lesser extent Narp, specifically in the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus, while Zif268 expression was elevated across both blades. Thus, object-place recognition triggers rapid, blade-specific upregulation of plasticity-associated immediate early genes. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of dentate gyrus homogenates demonstrated concomitant upregulation of three postsynaptic density proteins (Arc, PSD-95, and alpha-CaMKII) with key roles in long-term synaptic plasticity and long-term memory.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Focal ischaemia in the cerebral cortex affects the inducibility of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This impairment of hippocampal function may result from excessive activation of cortico-hippocampal afferents and subsequent perturbation of hippocampal LTP-relevant transmitter systems, which include opioids. Here, we tested if permanent focal ischaemia and electrical afferent stimulation influence the expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in the rat hippocampus. In the applied ischaemia model, the entire ipsilateral cortical hemisphere and hippocampus experienced sustained excitation as indicated by a long-lasting increase in the expression of arg 3.1/arc (ARG) mRNA, a marker for neuronal activity. Expression of MOR mRNA and protein was strongly increased in granule cells, which contain very low MOR levels under normal conditions, but not in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons, which express the MOR constitutively. In the molecular layer, which contains the dendrites of granule cells, focal ischaemia caused a redistribution of MOR-like immunoreactivity. In contrast to the dentate gyrus, MOR expression was unaltered in the hippocampus proper and in non-infarcted cortical areas. Repetitive high-frequency stimulation of cortico-hippocampal perforant path afferents induced strong MOR mRNA expression throughout the granular layer. However, weak tetanization sufficient to induce LTP and ARG expression did not influence MOR mRNA levels. Taken together, we provide direct evidence for the induction of MOR expression in granule cells experiencing sustained excitation by cortical afferents. In activated, MOR-expressing granule cells, inhibitory opioids may counter-regulate glutamatergic excitation by the perforant path.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Homer1a (H1a) is an immediate early gene involved in multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. It exhibits a postnatal increase in the rat forebrain (Brakeman et al. (1997) Nature 386:284-288) and reduces the density and size of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons (Sala et al. (2003) J Neurosci 23:6327-6337). We evaluated hippocampal H1a expression at different postnatal ages (P3, P5, P7, P9, P15, P19, P23, P35, and adult) using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and qRT-PCR. Maximal electroconvulsive shock (MECS) was used to induce maximal expression relative to home cage (HC) controls. Large scale images and confocal z-stacks from dorsal subiculum (DS), CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) were analyzed by both manual and automated methods. In DS, CA1, and CA3 a significant proportion of cells (40%) expressed small but detectable levels of H1a from P3; however, MECS did not up-regulate H1a during the first postnatal week. MECS induced H1a positive cells during the second postnatal week and induction reached adult levels at P9. H1a-Intra Nuclear Foci (INF) size and intensity varied with age, increasing at P19-23 in CA1 and CA3 and from P9 to P23 in DS. In DG, H1a expression exhibited a lamination pattern and an H1a-INF size and intensity gradient across the granule cell layer, consistent with the outside-in maturation of DG granule cells. The developmental progression of H1a corresponds to the synaptic refinement period supporting the conclusion that H1a could play an important role in this process.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pluripotent cytokine which affects the survival and differentiation of various types of cells both in the hematopoietic and nervous systems. In this study, the time course and localization of LIF mRNA expression following kainic acid-induced seizures were examined by northern blot analyses and in situ hybridization. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid at a convulsive dose induced LIF mRNA expression intensely in the hippocampus and moderately to weakly in the cerebral cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus. The expression peaked at 8-24 h after the injection in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and at 8 h in the thalamus and hypothalamus. In situ hybridization revealed different time courses of LIF mRNA expression depending on the area of the hippocampus; that is, the expression peaked at 10 h in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, then at 12 h in the polymorph and molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, and finally at 12-24 h in the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 and CA3 subfields. It is worth noting that the expression of LIF mRNA was intense in the dentate gyrus, the region where neurogenesis and aberrant network reorganization have been shown to be induced by seizures. The upregulation of LIF mRNA expression in the dentate granule cell layer followed by that in the dentate polymorph and molecular layers may be involved in activity-dependent neurogenesis in the granule cell layer and ectopic migration of granule cells to the polymorph and molecular layers in the dentate gyrus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"This study investigated the involvement of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in estradiol-induced enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult female rat. Subtype selective estrogen receptor agonists, propyl-pyrazole triol (estrogen receptor alpha agonist) and diarylpropionitrile (estrogen receptor beta agonist) were examined for each receptor's contribution, individual and cooperative, for estradiol-enhanced hippocampal cell proliferation. Estradiol increases hippocampal cell proliferation within 4 h [Ormerod BK, Lee TT, Galea LA (2003) Estradiol initially enhances but subsequently suppresses (via adrenal steroids) granule cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats. J Neurobiol 55:247-260]. Therefore, animals received s.c. injections of estradiol (10 microg), propyl-pyrazole triol and diarylpropionitrile alone (1.25, 2.5, 5.0 mg/0.1 ml dimethylsulfoxide) or in combination (2.5 mg propyl-pyrazole triol+2.5 mg diarylpropionitrile/0.1 ml dimethylsulfoxide) and 4 h later received an i.p. injection of the cell synthesis marker, bromodeoxyuridine (200 mg/kg). Diarylpropionitrile enhanced cell proliferation at all three administered doses (1.25 mg, P<0.008; 2.5 mg, P<0.003; 5 mg, P<0.005), whereas propyl-pyrazole triol significantly increased cell proliferation (P<0.0002) only at the dose of 2.5 mg. Our results demonstrate both estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta are individually involved in estradiol-enhanced cell proliferation. Furthermore both estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta mRNA was found co-localized with Ki-67 expression in the hippocampus albeit at low levels, indicating a potential direct influence of each receptor subtype on progenitor cells and their progeny. Dual receptor activation resulted in reduced levels of cell proliferation, supporting previous studies suggesting that estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta may modulate each other's activity. Our results also suggest that a component of estrogen receptor-regulated cell proliferation may take place through alternative ligand and/or cell-signaling mechanisms.\",\n",

       "  'Title': '\"Dormant basket cell\" hypothesis revisited: relative vulnerabilities of dentate gyrus mossy cells and inhibitory interneurons after hippocampal status epilepticus in the rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The \"dormant basket cell\" hypothesis suggests that postinjury hippocampal network hyperexcitability results from the loss of vulnerable neurons that normally excite insult-resistant inhibitory basket cells. We have reexamined the experimental basis of this hypothesis in light of reports that excitatory hilar mossy cells are not consistently vulnerable and inhibitory basket cells are not consistently seizure resistant. Prolonged afferent stimulation that reliably evoked granule cell discharges always produced extensive hilar neuron degeneration and immediate granule cell disinhibition. Conversely, kainic acid-induced status epilepticus in chronically implanted animals produced similarly extensive hilar cell loss and immediate granule cell disinhibition, but only when granule cells discharged continuously during status epilepticus. In both preparations, electron microscopy revealed degeneration of presynaptic terminals forming asymmetrical synapses in the mossy cell target zone, including some terminating on gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive elements, but no evidence of axosomatic or axoaxonic degeneration in the adjacent granule cell layer. Although parvalbumin immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed decreased staining, this apparently was due to altered parvalbumin expression rather than basket cell death, because substance P receptor-positive interneurons, some of which contained residual parvalbumin immunoreactivity, survived. These results confirm the inherent vulnerability of dendritically projecting hilar mossy cells and interneurons and the relative resistance of dentate inhibitory basket and chandelier cells that target granule cell somata. The variability of hippocampal cell loss after status epilepticus suggests that altered hippocampal structure and function cannot be assumed to cause the spontaneous seizures that develop in these animals and highlights the importance of confirming hippocampal pathology and pathophysiology in vivo in each case.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Differentiation and maturation of dentate gyrus granule cells requires coordinated interactions of numerous processes. These must be regulated by protein factors capable of integrating signals mediated through diverse signalling pathways. Such integrators of inter and intracellular physiological stimuli include the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), a leucine-zipper class transcription factor that is activated through phosphorylation. Neuronal activity and neurotrophic factors, known to be involved in granule cell differentiation, are major physiologic regulators of CREB function. To examine whether CREB may play a role in governing coordinated gene transcription during granule cell differentiation, we determined the spatial and temporal profiles of phosphorylated (activated) CREB throughout postnatal development in immature rat hippocampus. We demonstrate that CREB activation is confined to discrete, early stages of granule cell differentiation. In addition, CREB phosphorylation occurs prior to expression of the neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3. These data indicate that in a signal transduction cascade connecting CREB and neurotrophins in the process of granule cell maturation, CREB is located upstream of neurotrophins. Importantly, CREB may be a critical component of the machinery regulating the coordinated transcription of genes contributing to the differentiation of granule cells and their integration into the dentate gyrus network.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is often accompanied by granule cell dispersion (GCD), a migration defect of granule cells in the dentate gyrus. We have previously shown that a decrease in the expression of reelin, an extracellular matrix protein important for neuronal positioning, is associated with the development of GCD in TLE patients. Here, we used unilateral intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) in adult mice which is also associated with GCD formation and a decrease of reelin expression. In this mouse epilepsy model we aimed to prevent GCD development by the application of exogenous reelin. As a prerequisite we analyzed whether the reelin signaling transduction cascade was preserved in the KA-injected hippocampus. Using in situ hybridization and Western blot analysis we found that the expression of the reelin signaling components, apolipoprotein E receptor 2, the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor and the intracellular adaptor protein disabled 1, was maintained in dentate granule cells after KA injection. Next, recombinant reelin was infused into the KA-injected hippocampus by osmotic minipumps over a period of 2 weeks. Quantitative analysis of granule cell layer width revealed a significant reduction of GCD in reelin-treated, but not in saline-infused animals when compared to KA injection alone. Our findings highlight the crucial role of reelin for the maintenance of granule cell lamination in the dentate gyrus of adult mice and show that a reelin deficiency is causally involved in GCD development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The interactions of glia and neurons during injury and subsequent neurodegeneration are a subject of interest both in disease and chemical-induced brain injury. One such model is the prototypical hippocampal toxicant trimethyltin (TMT). An acute injection of TMT (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) to postnatal day 21 CD-1 male mice produced neuronal necrosis and loss of dentate granule cells, astrocyte hypertrophy, and microglia activation in the hippocampus within 24 hrs. Neuronal necrosis and microglia differentiation to a phagocytic phenotype is temporally correlated with peak elevations in TNF-alpha, cyclin A2, cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 at 72 h post-TMT. TNF-alpha mRNA levels were significantly elevated in the hippocampus by 12 h and remained elevated for 72 h. mRNA levels for cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 were elevated by approximately 2-fold at 72 h. Immunohistochemistry suggested a cellular localization of cyclin A to microglia in the region of neuronal necrosis in the dentate, cyclin B in glial cells in juxtaposition to neurons in the hilus of the hippocampus and cyclin D1 to non-glial cells in the dentate. mRNA levels for cyclin D1 were elevated approximately 1.5-fold by 72 h as determined by RNase protection assay. No changes were seen in mRNA levels for cyclins E, F, G1, G2, H or I nor cyclin dependent kinases. These elevations are not associated with proliferation of microglia as determined by BrdU incorporation and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Upregulation of cell cycle genes was associated with cellular processes other than proliferation and may contribute to the differentiation of microglia to a phagocytic phenotype. These data suggest an integrated role for cell cycle regulation of neural cells in the manifestation of hippocampal pathophysiology.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Drebrin A expression is altered after pilocarpine-induced seizures: time course of changes is consistent for a role in the integrity and stability of dendritic spines of hippocampal granule cells.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'We used a pathophysiological model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in adult rats in order to assess the in vivo role of drebrin A (DA), one of the major regulators of F-actin. This model displays a dynamic reorganization of the glutamatergic network including neo-spinogenesis, morphogenesis, and neo-synaptogenesis associated with an aberrant sprouting of granule cell axons in the dentate gyrus (DG). This reactive plasticity contributes in dentate granule-cell hyperexcitability that could lead to the emergence of recurrent spontaneous seizures. We investigated the hippocampal DA expression changes in pilocarpine animals using immunohistochemical, Western blot, and in situ hybridization analyses. We showed that DA immunoreactivity was decreased in the inner molecular layer (IML) and in the hilus (H) of the DG, at latent stage, when spinogenesis and morphogenesis occur. Western blot analysis confirmed these overall hippocampal decreases of DA protein expression. At chronic stage, when newly formed glutamatergic synapses are being established, the levels of immunolabeling for DA in the H and the IML were similar to control rats. This recovery is likely due to the increase of DA mRNA in perikarya of hilar and granule cells. Interestingly, our data showed that the changes pattern of labeling for Bassoon, a specific marker for presynaptic active zone, in the IML of pilocarpine-treated animals paralleled those found for DA at all time points examined. Furthermore, our double and triple immunofluorescence studies showed that the recovery in DA levels in the IML occurred within the dendritic spines involved in glutamatergic active synapses of presumed granule cells. Altogether, our results indicate that in vivo DA is not critical for spinogenesis and morphogenesis but instead is consistent with an involvement in synaptic structural integrity, stabilization, and function. Thus, DA appears as a novel modulator of reactive synaptic plasticity associated with epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"In rodent models for neuropsychiatric disorders reduced number of hippocampal interneurons have been reported, but the total number of GABAergic neurons in the normal rat hippocampus is yet unknown. We used in situ hybridization method to label the 65 isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) and counted the number of GAD65 mRNA-expressing neurons along the entire septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. We found that 2/3 of the interneurons were in Ammon's horn (61,590) and 1/3 in the dentate gyrus (28,000). We observed the following numbers in Ammon's horn: CA3 area 33,400, CA2 area 4,190, CA1 area 24,000 and in the dentate gyrus: 6,000 in the molecular and 9,000 in the granule cell layers and 13,000 in the hilus. GAD65 mRNA-expressing neurons were significantly more numerous in dorsal than in ventral hippocampus. The ratio between interneurons and principal cells was lowest in the granule cell layer (0.9%) and highest in hilus (21%). In Ammon's horn this ratio was constant being 13% in CA3 and 8% in CA1-2 areas. In the entire hippocampal formation, the interneuron/principal cell ratio was 6%, with a significant difference between Ammon's horn (9.5%) and the dentate gyrus (2.8%) including the hilus. Such low ratios could suggest that even a limited loss of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus may have a considerable functional impact. \",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Patients and models of temporal lobe epilepsy have fewer inhibitory interneurons in the dentate gyrus than controls, but it is unclear whether granule cell inhibition is reduced. We report the loss of GABAergic inhibition of granule cells in the temporal dentate gyrus of pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats. In situ hybridization for GAD65 mRNA and immunocytochemistry for parvalbumin and somatostatin confirmed the loss of inhibitory interneurons. In epileptic rats, granule cells had prolonged EPSPs, and they discharged more action potentials than controls. Although the conductances of evoked IPSPs recorded in normal ACSF were not significantly reduced and paired-pulse responses showed enhanced inhibition of granule cells from epileptic rats, more direct measures of granule cell inhibition revealed significant deficiencies. In granule cells from epileptic rats, evoked monosynaptic IPSP conductances were <40% of controls, and the frequency of GABA(A) receptor-mediated spontaneous and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) was <50% of controls. Within 3-7 d after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, miniature IPSC frequency had decreased, and it remained low, without functional evidence of compensatory synaptogenesis by GABAergic axons in chronically epileptic rats. Both parvalbumin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive interneuron numbers and the frequency of both fast- and slow-rising GABA(A) receptor-mediated mIPSCs were reduced, suggesting that loss of inhibitory synaptic input to granule cells occurred at both proximal/somatic and distal/dendritic sites. Reduced granule cell inhibition in the temporal dentate gyrus preceded the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures by days to weeks, so it may contribute, but is insufficient, to cause epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The human polyomavirus JC (JCV) infects glial cells and is the etiologic agent of the CNS demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. JCV can infect granule cell neurons of the cerebellum, causing JCV granule cell neuronopathy and cortical pyramidal neurons in JCV encephalopathy. Whether JCV also infects neurons in other areas of the CNS is unclear. We determined the prevalence and pattern of JCV infection of the hippocampus in archival samples from 28 patients with known JCV infection of the CNS and 66 control subjects. Among 28 patients, 11 (39.3%) had JCV infection of hippocampus structures demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Those included gray matter (dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis, subiculum) in 11/11 and afferent or efferent white matter tracts (perforant path, alveus, fimbria) in 10/11. In the hippocampus, JCV infected granule cell and pyramidal neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Although glial cells expressed either JCV regulatory T Antigen or JCV VP1 capsid protein, infected neurons expressed JCV T Antigen only, suggesting an abortive/restrictive infection. None of the 66 control subjects had evidence of hippocampal JCV protein expression by immunohistochemistry or JCV DNA by in situ hybridization. These results greatly expand our understanding of JCV pathogenesis in the CNS.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Loss of BETA2/NeuroD leads to malformation of the dentate gyrus and epilepsy.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'BETA2/NeuroD is a homologue of the Drosophila atonal gene that is widely expressed during development in the mammalian brain and pancreas. Although studies in Xenopus suggest that BETA2/NeuroD is involved in cellular differentiation, its function in the mammalian nervous system is unclear. Here we show that mutant mice homozygous for a deletion at the BETA2/NeuroD locus fail to develop a granule cell layer within the dentate gyrus, one of the principal structures of the hippocampal formation. To understand the basis of this abnormality, we analyzed dentate gyrus development by using immunocytochemical markers in BETA2/NeuroD-deficient mice. The early cell populations in the dentate gyrus, including Cajal-Retzius cells and radial glia, are present and appear normally organized. The migration of dentate precursor cells and newly born granule cells from the neuroepithelium to the dentate gyrus remains intact. However, there is a dramatic defect in the proliferation of precursor cells once they reach the dentate and a significant delay in the differentiation of granule cells. This leads to malformation of the dentate granule cell layer and excess cell death. BETA2/NeuroD null mice also exhibit spontaneous limbic seizures associated with electrophysiological evidence of seizure activity in the hippocampus and cortex. These findings thus establish a critical role of BETA2/NeuroD in the development of a specific class of neurons. Furthermore, failure to express BETA2/NeuroD leads to a stereotyped pattern of pathological excitability of the adult central nervous system.',\n",

To support this hypothesis, we examined the mRNA expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), a glutamatergic gene marker, and Prox1, a selective gene marker for granule cells of the dentate gyrus, in the turtle medial cortex (zone 2). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of both mRNAs in the turtle cerebrum. In situ hybridization of zone 2, which is a layer of densely packed neurons in Nissl stains, intensely expressed vGluT1 and Prox1. In zone 3, which is a loosely packed layer, vGluT1 was intensely expressed, whereas Prox1 signals gradated from strong to negative toward zone 4. These findings demonstrate that zone 2 contains glutamatergic neurons and expresses Prox1 mRNA and suggest that zone 2 in the turtle cerebrum is homologous to the mammalian dentate gyrus.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Nonuniform allocation of hippocampal neurons to place fields across all hippocampal subfields.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The mechanisms governing how the hippocampus selects neurons to exhibit place fields are not well understood. A default assumption in some previous studies was the uniform random draw with replacement (URDWR) model, which, theoretically, maximizes spatial \"pattern separation\", and predicts a Poisson distribution of the numbers of place fields expressed by a given cell per unit area. The actual distribution of mean firing rates exhibited by a population of hippocampal neurons, however, is approximately exponential or log-normal in a given environment and these rates are somewhat correlated across multiple places, at least under some conditions. The advantage of neural activity-dependent immediate-early gene (IEG) analysis, as a proxy for electrophysiological recording, is the ability to obtain much larger samples of cells, even those whose activity is so sparse that they are overlooked in recording studies. Thus, a more accurate representation of the activation statistics can potentially be achieved. Some previous IEG studies that examined behavior-driven IEG expression in CA1 appear to support URDWR. There was, however, in some of the same studies, an under-recruitment of dentate gyrus granule cells, indicating a highly skewed excitability distribution, which is inconsistent with URDWR. Although it was suggested that this skewness might be related to increased excitability of recently generated granule cells, we show here that CA1, CA3, and subiculum also exhibit cumulative under-recruitment of neurons. Thus, a highly skewed excitability distribution is a general principle common to all major hippocampal subfields. Finally, a more detailed analysis of the frequency distributions of IEG intranuclear transcription foci suggests that a large fraction of hippocampal neurons is virtually silent, even during sleep. Whether the skewing of the excitability distribution is cell-intrinsic or a network phenomenon, and the degree to which this excitability is fixed or possibly time-varying are open questions for future studies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Somatostatin receptor type 2 undergoes plastic changes in the human epileptic dentate gyrus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by hippocampal sclerosis together with profound losses and phenotypic changes of different classes of interneurons, including those expressing somatostatin (SRIF). To understand the functional significance of the plasticity of SRIF transmission in TLE, unraveling the status of SRIF receptors is, however, a prerequisite. To address this issue, we characterized expression and distribution of the major SRIF receptor, the sst2 subtype, in hippocampal tissue resected in patients with TLE using complementary neuroanatomic approaches. In patients with hippocampal sclerosis, the number of cells expressing sst2 receptor mRNA as well as sst2 receptor-binding sites and immunoreactivity decreased significantly in the CA1-3, reflecting neuronal loss. By contrast, in the dentate gyrus, sst2 receptor mRNA expression was strongly increased in the granule cell layer, and sst2 receptor-binding sites and immunoreactivity was preserved in the inner but decreased significantly in the outer molecular layer. In this latter region, pronounced changes in SRIF terminal fields were observed. Decreased receptor density in the distal dendrites of granule cells is likely to reflect downregulation of sst2 receptors in response to physiopathologic release of SRIF. Because sst2 receptors have anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic properties, this phenomenon may contribute to the etiology of TLE seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study examined the relationship between the development of cholinergic axons originating from the septum and a group of their target cells, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the rat. Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry was used to identify septal cholinergic afferents to the dentate gyrus; parallel studies used anterograde movement of a carbocyanine dye to label the septal projections. Septal cholinergic axons are present in the molecular layer of the internal blade of the dentate gyrus shortly after birth, but these axons do not reach the external blade until several days later. Results demonstrate that acetylcholinesterase positive septal axons grow into the external blade of the dentate gyrus only after the recently generated granule cells have coalesced to form a clearly defined layer. Results from studies using in situ hybridization techniques demonstrate that dentate gyrus granule cells express messenger RNAs for brain derived neurotrophic factor and for neurotrophic factor 3 shortly after formation of the granule cell layer. Ingrowth of septal cholinergic axons follows two days after the formation of the external blade of the dentate gyrus and the expression of neurotrophin messenger RNAs by the dentate granule cells. These data support the hypothesis that target cell development is a prerequisite for attracting the ingrowth of septal afferent axons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The temporal and spatial distribution of glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) mRNA-containing neurons in the dentate gyrus was analyzed from embryonic day 20 (E20) to postnatal day 15 (PN15) with nonradioactive in situ hybridization methods. A major goal was to follow the development of an early-appearing population of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons within the developing molecular layer. At E20, GAD67 mRNA-containing neurons were highly concentrated slightly above the outer border of the developing granule cell layer. By PN3-PN5, many labeled cells were distributed within the developing granule cell layer; by PN15, labeled neurons occupied positions normally seen in the adult, such as along the inner border of the granule cell layer. This developmental pattern is unique and led to additional studies to determine the potential fate of the early-appearing GABA population. The possibility of apoptotic cell death was investigated with in situ end labeling techniques at developmental ages E21-PN15. Very few apoptotic cells were detected in the developing molecular layer at all ages examined. Birthdating studies of neurons labeled with bromodeoxyuridine revealed a changing pattern, similar to that of GAD67 mRNA, for cells with birthdates (E14) of many of the mature GAD-containing neurons in the dentate gyrus. The changes in the mRNA and birthdating patterns from E20-PN15 suggest that some of the early-appearing GABA neurons within the developing molecular layer of the dentate gyrus may alter their positions to eventually become the mature GABA population along the inner border of the granule cell layer.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Recently, expression of glutamate decarboxylase-67 (GAD67), a key enzyme of GABA synthesis, was detected in the otherwise glutamatergic mossy fibers of the rat hippocampus. Synthesis of the enzyme was markedly enhanced after experimentally induced status epilepticus. Here, we investigated the expression of GAD67 protein and mRNA in 44 hippocampal specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using double immunofluorescence histochemistry, immunoblotting, and in situ hybridization. Both in specimens with (n = 37) and without (n = 7) hippocampal sclerosis, GAD67 was highly coexpressed with dynorphin in terminal areas of mossy fibers, including the dentate hilus and the stratum lucidum of sector CA3. In the cases with Ammon's horn sclerosis, also the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus contained strong staining for GAD67 immunoreactivity, indicating labeling of mossy fiber terminals that specifically sprout into this area. Double immunofluorescence revealed the colocalization of GAD67 immunoreactivity with the mossy fiber marker dynorphin. The extent of colabeling correlated with the number of seizures experienced by the patients. Furthermore, GAD67 mRNA was found in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Levels, both of GAD67 mRNA and of GAD67 immunoreactivity were similar in sclerotic and nonsclerotic specimens and appeared to be increased compared to post mortem controls. Provided that the strong expression of GAD67 results in synthesis of GABA in hippocampal mossy fibers this may represent a self-protecting mechanism in TLE. In addition GAD67 expression also may result in conversion of excessive intracellular glutamate to nontoxic GABA within mossy fiber terminals.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Protein deprivation leads to neuronal and synaptic loss in the hippocampal formation, and to behavioral changes. We suggested that these effects could result from alterations in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). To investigate this issue, adult rats were submitted to protein deprivation for 6 months and compared with controls. The number of neurons of the dentate gyrus granular layer containing BDNF and TrkB was estimated from immunostained sections and the mRNA levels of BDNF and TrkB evaluated using in situ hybridization. After treatment, there was a loss of BDNF- and TrkB-immunoreactive cells and a reduction of the mRNA levels. Thus, it is likely that the decreased neurotrophic activity in the dentate gyrus of malnourished animals underpins neuronal degeneration and the ensuing behavioral alterations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'During embryonic cortical development, expression of Tis21 is associated with cell cycle lengthening and neurogenic divisions of progenitor cells. We here investigated if the expression pattern of Tis21 also correlates with the generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. We used Tis21 knock-in mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and studied Tis21-GFP expression together with markers of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in newly generated cells. We found that Tis21-GFP 1) was absent from the radial glia-like putative stem cells (type-1 cells), 2) first appeared in transient amplifying progenitor cells (type-2 and 3 cells), 3) did not colocalize with markers of early postmitotic maturation stage, 4) was expressed again in maturing neurons, and 5) finally decreased in mature granule cells. Our data show that, in the course of adult neurogenesis, Tis21 is expressed in a phase additional to the one of the embryonic neurogenesis. This additional phase of expression might be associated with a new and different function of Tis21 than during embryonic brain development, where no Tis21 is expressed in mature neurons. We hypothesize that this function is related to the final functional integration of the newborn neurons. Tis21 can thus serve as new marker for key stages of adult neurogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainic acid-induced seizures cause a marked increase in the expression of glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. To determine the possible modes of sequestration of newly formed gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), we used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to investigate the expression of several proteins related to GABA in dentate granule cells of rats 4 h to 60 days after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus and in controls. GAD67 and GAD65 mRNA levels were increased by up to 300% and 800%, respectively, in the granule cell layer 6-24 h after kainate injection. Subsequently, increased GAD and GABA immunoreactivity was observed in the terminal field of mossy fibers and in presumed dendrites of granule cells. mRNA of both known plasma membrane GABA transporters (GAT-1 and GAT-3) was expressed in granule cells of control rats. GAT-1 mRNA levels increased (by 30%) 9 h after kainate injection but were reduced by about 25% at later intervals. GAT-3 mRNA was reduced (by 35-75%) in granule cells 4 h to 30 days after kainic acid injection. In contrast, no expression of the mRNA or immunoreactivity of the vesicular GABA transporter was detected in granule cells or in mossy fibers, respectively. GABA transaminase mRNA was only faintly expressed in granule cells, and its levels were reduced (by 60-65%) 12 h to 30 days after kainate treatment. The results indicate that GABA can be taken up and synthesized in granule cells. No evidence for the expression of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in granule cells was obtained. After sustained epileptic seizures, the markedly increased expression of glutamate decarboxylase and the reduced expression of GABA transaminase may result in increased cytoplasmic GABA concentrations in granule cells. It is suggested that, during epileptic seizures, elevated intracellular GABA and sodium concentration could then result in nonvesicular release of GABA from granule cell dendrites. GABA could then act on GABA-A receptors, protecting granule cells from overexcitation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Activation of the hippocampal dopamine 1-class receptors (D1R and D5R) are implicated in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). However, the specific role of the D1R versus D5R in hippocampal dependent CFC has not been investigated. Generation of D1R- and D5R-specific in situ hybridization probes showed that D1R and D5R mRNA expression was greatest in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. To identify the role of each receptor in CFC we generated spatially restricted KO mice that lack either the D1R or D5R in DG granule cells. DG D1R KOs displayed significant fear memory deficits, whereas DG D5R KOs did not. Furthermore, D1R KOs but not D5R KOs, exhibited generalized fear between two similar but different contexts. In the familiar home cage context, c-Fos expression was relatively low in the DG of control mice, and it increased upon exposure to a novel context. This level of c-Fos expression in the DG did not further increase when a footshock was delivered in the novel context. In DG D1R KOs, DG c-Fos levels in the home cage was higher than that of the control mice, but it did not further increase upon exposure to a novel context and remained at the same level upon a shock delivery. In contrast, the levels of DG c-Fos expression was unaffected by the deletion of DG D5R neither in the home cage nor upon a shock delivery. These results suggest that DG D1Rs, but not D5Rs, contribute to the formation of distinct contextual representations of novel environments. ',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Evidence for changing positions of GABA neurons in the developing rat dentate gyrus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In recent studies, we demonstrated a distinct change in the distribution of glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) mRNA-containing neurons within the rat dentate gyrus from embryonic day 20 (E20) to postnatal day 15 (PN15) (Dupuy and Houser, J Comp Neurol 1997;389:402-418). We also observed a similar changing pattern for cells with birthdates of many of the mature GAD-containing neurons in the dentate gyrus (Dupuy and Houser, J Comp Neurol 1997;389:402-418). These observations suggested that some early-appearing GABA neurons within the developing molecular layer of the dentate gyrus may gradually alter their positions to become the mature GABAergic cells along the inner border of the granule cell layer. The goal of the present study was to provide additional evidence for our hypothesis by demonstrating the spatial relationships between GAD-containing neurons and granule cells at progressively older ages during development. In this study, immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization methods for the localization of GAD67 or its mRNA were combined with bromodeoxyuridine birthdating techniques that labeled early-generated granule cells with birthdates on E17. At E20, GAD67-containing neurons were located above the granule cell layer that contained E17 birthdated granule cells. During the first two postnatal weeks, both GAD67 mRNA-containing neurons and early-born granule cells were primarily concentrated within the granule cell layer. Double-labeled neurons were rarely observed, and this suggests that these two groups are separate populations. By PN15-PN30, most GAD67 mRNA-containing neurons were distributed along the base of the granule cell layer, significantly below the E17 birthdated granule cells. These findings support our new hypothesis that mature GABA neurons along the inner border of the granule cell layer reach their positions by migrating or translocating through the developing granule cell layer.',\n",

The apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), encoded by the Nol3 gene, is a potent and multifunctional death repressor that inhibits both death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. The aim of the present study was to parse the role of ARC in the development of new granule cell neurons. Nol3 gene expression as revealed by in situ hybridization is present in the entire dentate granule cell layer. Moreover, a comparison of Nol3 expression between FACS-sorted Sox2-positive neural stem cells and Doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons demonstrates upregulation of Nol3 during neurogenesis. Using ARC-deficient mice, we show that proliferation and survival of BrdU birth-dated cells are strongly reduced in the absence of ARC while neuronal-glial fate choice is not affected.

       "  'Abstract': 'Impaired folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (OCM) has emerged as a risk factor for several diseases associated with age-related cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown and thus hinder the identification of subpopulations most vulnerable to OCM disruption. Here we investigated the role of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1), a folate-dependent enzyme regulating de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, in influencing neuronal and cognitive function in the adult mouse. We observed Shmt1 expression in the hippocampus, including the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), and examined hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning in mice deficient for Shmt1. We used a 3 × 3 design in which adult male Shmt1(+/+), Shmt1(+/-), and Shmt1(-/-) mice were fed folic acid control (2 mg/kg), folic acid-deficient (0 mg/kg), or folic acid-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diets from weaning through the duration of the study. Proliferation within the DG was elevated by 70% in Shmt1(+/-) mice, yet the number of newborn mature neurons was reduced by 98% compared with that in Shmt1(+/+) mice. Concomitant with these alterations, Shmt1(+/-) mice showed a 45% reduction in mnemonic recall during trace fear conditioning. Dietary folate manipulations alone did not influence neural outcomes. Together, these data identify SHMT1 as one of the first enzymes within the OCM pathway to regulate neuronal and cognitive profiles and implicate impaired thymidylate biosynthesis in the etiology of folate-related neuropathogenesis.

       "  'Abstract': 'Experiments in rodents and marmoset monkeys indicate that granule neurons of the dentate gyrus may be renewable throughout the entire life of the animal. Whether this occurs in larger primates remains a matter of contention. However, a recent study of brain samples from five adult humans who had been injected with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine indicates that new neurons might indeed be produced in the dentate gyrus. In this study, hippocampus specimens removed from 18 adult humans for treatment of epilepsy were examined. The cell cycle marker Ki67, which is expressed from late G1 to M phase, was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, and H2b/H3/H4 histone mRNAs, which are expressed during S phase, were demonstrated by in situ hybridization. Only 0.17% of cells in the subgranular layer, the site of neuronal progenitor cells, were Ki67 immunoreactive but the identity of these could not be proven. Although the histone in situ hybridization technique was shown to work in human fetal brain, no M phase cells could be demonstrated in the hippocampus. The generation of new granule neurons in the human hippocampus must occur at a very slow rate. The approaches used in this study are likely unsuitable for studying cell populations with low turnover rate. Further work is needed to determine the fate of newly generated cells in the dentate gyrus. This information is of importance to our understanding of the mechanisms of learning and memory.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the present in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical studies in the mouse central nervous system (CNS), a strong expression of spastin mRNA and protein was found in Purkinje cells and dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, in hippocampal principal cells and hilar neurons, in amygdala, substantia nigra, striatum, in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and in different layers of the cerebral cortex except piriform and entorhinal cortices where only neurons in layer II were strongly stained. Spastin protein and mRNA were weakly expressed in most of the thalamic nuclei. In selected human brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, substania nigra and striatum, similar results were obtained. Electron microscopy showed spastin immunopositive staining in the cytoplasma, dendrites, axon terminals and nucleus. In the mouse pilocarpine model of status epilepticus and subsequent temporal lobe epilepsy, spastin expression disappeared in hilar neurons as early as at 2h during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus, and never recovered. At 7 days and 2 months after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus, spastin expression was down-regulated in granule cells in the dentate gyrus, but induced expression was found in reactive astrocytes. The demonstration of widespread distribution of spastin in functionally different brain regions in the present study may provide neuroanatomical basis to explain why different neurological, psychological disorders and cognitive impairment occur in patients with spastin mutation. Down-regulation or loss of spastin expression in hilar neurons may be related to their degeneration and may therefore initiate epileptogenetic events, leading to temporal lobe epilepsy.',\n",

But only little information has been available in how far the situation in animal models would reflect the conditions in the adult and aging human brain. We therefore here mapped numerous features associated with adult neurogenesis in rodents in samples from human hippocampus across the entire lifespan. Such data would not offer proof of adult neurogenesis in humans, because it is based on the assumption that humans and rodents share marker expression patterns in adult neurogenesis.

We studied 54 individuals and detected DCX expression between birth and 100 years of age. Caveats for post-mortem analyses of human tissues apply but all samples were free of signs of ischemia and activated caspase-3. Fourteen markers related to adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents were assessed in DCX-positive cells. Total numbers of DCX expressing cells declined exponentially with increasing age, and co-expression of DCX with the other markers decreased. This argued against a non-specific re-appearance of immature markers in specimen from old brains. Early postnatally all 14 markers were co-expressed in DCX-positive cells. Until 30 to 40 years of age, for example, an overlap of DCX with Ki67, Mcm2, Sox2, Nestin, Prox1, PSA-NCAM, Calretinin, NeuN, and others was detected, and some key markers (Nestin, Sox2, Prox1) remained co-expressed into oldest age.')]),\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The neurogenic potential of the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is likely to be regulated by molecular cues arising from its complex heterogeneous cellular environment. Through transcriptome analysis using laser microdissection coupled with DNA microarrays, in combination with analysis of genome-wide in situ hybridization data, we identified 363 genes selectively enriched in adult mouse SGZ. These genes reflect expression in the different constituent cell types, including progenitor and dividing cells, immature granule cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and GABAergic interneurons. Similar transcriptional profiling in the rhesus monkey dentate gyrus across postnatal development identified a highly overlapping set of SGZ-enriched genes, which can be divided based on temporal profiles to reflect maturation of glia versus granule neurons. Furthermore, we identified a neurogenesis-related gene network with decreasing postnatal expression that is highly correlated with the declining number of proliferating cells in dentate gyrus over postnatal development. Many of the genes in this network showed similar postnatal downregulation in mouse, suggesting a conservation of molecular mechanisms underlying developmental and adult neurogenesis in rodents and primates. Conditional deletion of Sox4 and Sox11, encoding two neurogenesis-related transcription factors central in this network, produces a mouse with no hippocampus, confirming the crucial role for these genes in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis.

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), the mammalian homologue of frequenin, is a member of a highly conserved family of neuron-specific calcium-binding proteins which has been implicated in exocytosis and in multiple calcium-signalling pathways, suggesting a potential involvement in mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. Here, using in situ hybridization, we report an increased induction of the mRNA encoding NCS-1 in dentate granule cells following the induction of long-term potentiation in the awake rat. We show that NCS-1 mRNA levels are increased 1 and 3 h after long-term potentiation in an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent manner, returning to baseline expression levels by 6 h. Electroconvulsive stimulation also induced NCS-1 mRNA transcription in the dentate gyrus, but at the different time of 6 h post-seizure, returning to baseline by 12 h. These results show that regulated expression of the NCS-1 gene is part of the transcriptional response associated with activity-dependent neuronal plasticity in vivo and suggest a molecular mechanism capable of mediating a functional change in synapse sensitivity to calcium and calcium-signalling pathways after long-term potentiation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Neuron navigator 2 (NAV2, RAINB1, POMFIL2, HELAD1, unc53H2) is essential for nervous system development. In the present study the spatial distribution of Nav2 transcript in mouse CNS during embryonic, postnatal and adult life is examined. Because multiple NAV2 proteins are predicted based on alternate promoter usage and RNA splicing, in situ hybridization was performed using probes designed to the 5' and 3' ends of the Nav2 transcript, and PCR products using primer sets spanning the length of the mRNA were also examined by real time PCR (qPCR). These studies support full-length Nav2 transcript as the predominant form in the wild-type mouse CNS. The developing cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and granule cells (GC) within the cerebellum show the highest expression, with a similar staining pattern using either the 5'Nav2 or 3'Nav2 probe. Nav2 is expressed in GC precursors migrating over the cerebellar primordium as well as in the postmitotic premigratory cells of the external granule cell layer (EGL). It is expressed in the cornu ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus (DG) throughout hippocampal development. In situ hybridization was combined with immunohistochemistry for Ki67, CTIP2 and Nissl staining to follow Nav2 transcript location during cortical development, where it is observed in neuroepithelial cells exiting the germinal compartments, as well as later in the cortical plate (CP) and developing cortical layers. The highest levels of Nav2 in all brain regions studied are observed in late gestation and early postnatal life which coincides with times when neurons are migrating and differentiating. A hypomorphic mouse that lacks the full-length transcript but expresses shorter transcript shows little staining in the CNS with either probe set except at the base of the cerebellum, where a shorter Nav2 transcript is detected. Using dual fluorescent probe in situ hybridization studies, these cells are identified as oligodendrocytes and are detected using both Olig1 and the 3'Nav2 probe. The identification of full-length Nav2 as the primary transcript in numerous brain regions suggests NAV2 could play a role in CNS development beyond that of its well-established role in the cerebellum.\",\n",

However, neuropathological and functional abnormalities have also been discovered in the brain of Wobbler mice and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study examined the hippocampus of control and afflicted Wobbler mice and the changes in response to progesterone treatment. Mice received either a single progesterone implant (20\\xa0mg for 18\\xa0days). We found that the hippocampal pathology of the untreated Wobblers involved a decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, decreased astrogliosis in the stratum lucidum, stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, decreased doublecortin (DCX)-positive\\xa0neuroblasts in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and a decreased density of GABA immunoreactive hippocampal interneurones and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Although progesterone did not change the normal parameters of control mice, it attenuated several hippocampal abnormalities in Wobblers. Thus, progesterone increased hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression, decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and increased the number of GABAergic interneurones and granule cells. The number of DCX expressing neuroblasts and immature neurones remained impaired in both progesterone-treated and untreated Wobblers. In conclusion, progesterone treatment exerted beneficial effects on some aspects of hippocampal neuropathology, suggesting its neuroprotective role in the brain, in agreement with previous data obtained in the spinal cord of Wobbler mice.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) system of the hippocampal formation of Macaca fascicularis monkeys was studied immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody to GABA and with nonisotopic in situ hybridization with cRNA probes for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and GAD67. The highest densities of labeled cells were observed in the presubiculum, parasubiculum, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum, whereas the CA3 field and the dentate gyrus had the lowest densities of positive neurons. Within the dentate gyrus, most of the GABAergic neurons were located in the polymorphic layer and in the deep portion of the granule cell layer. GABAergic terminals were densest in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer. GABAergic neurons were seen throughout all layers of the hippocampus. Terminal labeling was highest in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. A higher terminal labeling was observed in the subiculum than in CA1 and was particularly prominent in layer II of the presubiculum. A bundle of GABAergic fibers was visible deep to the cell layers of the presubiculum and subiculum. This bundle could be followed into the angular bundle ipsilaterally and was continuous with stained fibers in the dorsal hippocampal commissure. This pattern of labeling is reminiscent of the presubicular projections to the contralateral entorhinal cortex. GABAergic cells were observed in all layers of the entorhinal cortex although the density was higher in layers II and III than in layers V and VI. The in situ hybridization preparations largely confirmed the distribution of GABAergic neurons in all fields of the hippocampal formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are membrane-derived lipids that are utilized as signaling molecules in the nervous system (e.g., the endocannabinoid anandamide). An N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) that catalyzes formation of NAEs was recently identified as a member of the zinc metallohydrolase family of enzymes. NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice have greatly reduced brain levels of long-chain saturated NAEs but wild-type levels of polyunsaturated NAEs (e.g., anandamide), suggesting an important role for NAPE-PLD in the biosynthesis of at least a subset of endogenous NAEs in the mammalian nervous system. To provide a neuroanatomical basis for investigation of NAPE-PLD function, here we have analyzed expression of NAPE-PLD in the mouse brain using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice were utilized to establish the specificity of probes/antibodies used. The most striking feature of NAPE-PLD expression in the brain was in the dentate gyrus, where a strong mRNA signal was detected in granule cells. Accordingly, immunocytochemical analysis revealed intense NAPE-PLD immunoreactivity in the axons of granule cells (mossy fibers). Intense NAPE-PLD immunoreactivity was also detected in axons of the vomeronasal nerve that project to the accessory olfactory bulb. NAPE-PLD expression was detected in other brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus), but the intensity of immunostaining was weaker than in mossy fibers. Collectively, the data obtained indicate that NAPE-PLD is expressed by specific populations of neurons in the brain and targeted to axonal processes. We suggest that NAEs generated by NAPE-PLD in axons may act as anterograde synaptic signaling molecules that regulate the activity of postsynaptic neurons.',\n",

Using both Northern blot and in situ hybridization techniques, we investigated whether MARCKS expression varied according to the cerebral region, including the hippocampal formation, or according to the type of neuron. Northern blot analysis showed that the MARCKS mRNA level was higher in the association areas than in the primary sensory and motor areas of the cerebral neocortex. MARCKS mRNA levels in the hippocampus and the amygdala were as high as those in the association areas. The in situ hybridization experiments confirmed the Northern blot results and showed the distribution and characteristics of MARCKS mRNA-positive neurons. In the association areas of the neocortex, prominent signals were observed in neurons in layers II-VI. In the primary areas, prominent signals were restricted to neurons in layers IV-VI. In the hippocampus, the most intense hybridization signals were observed in neurons in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus.

       "  'Abstract': 'Following destruction of entorhinal cortical (EC) input to the dentate gyrus there is an increase in protein synthesis within the denervated dendritic laminae. The present study utilized in situ hybridization to determine whether there were increases in the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for beta-actin and beta-tubulin within the denervated neuropil of the dentate gyrus during the time of increased protein synthesis. Animals were prepared for in situ hybridization 2-21 days after a unilateral lesion of the EC. Brain sections were hybridized with either 3H or 35S-labeled riboprobes prepared from chick beta-actin and chick beta-tubulin mRNA. Analysis of light microscopic autoradiograms revealed increases in the mRNAs for beta-actin and beta-tubulin within the denervated neuropil between 6 and 8 days postlesion when compared to the intact dentate gyrus of the contralateral side. Labeling over the granule cell body layer was comparable on the two sides for both probes. Increases in both mRNAs were also observed in the scar tissue at the lesion site. These results suggest that local protein synthesis within the denervated neuropil of the dentate gyrus involves, in part, an increase in the production of actin and tubulin.',\n",

With the concept that reelin might also be important for axonal growth in the injured nervous system we investigated whether reelin is re-expressed in areas of collateral sprouting after brain injury. The expression of reelin messenger RNA was studied in the denervated fascia dentata of adult rats one, four, seven and 14 days following entorhinal cortex lesion. In adult control animals, in situ hybridization histochemistry with digoxigenin-labeled reelin riboprobes revealed reelin messenger RNA expression in neurons located in the outer molecular layer and beneath the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. After entorhinal cortex lesion, this expression pattern did not change during the whole post-lesional time period investigated despite a strong glial activation and reactive sprouting in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus as visualized by immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, respectively.

       "  'Abstract': \"Members of the catenin family of proteins are thought to play a major role in the folding and lamination of the cerebral cortex. We have used in situ hybridization to determine the cellular expression patterns of four members of this family, Alpha-E-, Alpha-N-, Beta-, and Gamma-catenins (CTNNA1, CTNNA2, CTNNB1, and JUP respectively) in the adult primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus. CTNNA2, CTNNB1, and JUP mRNAs were detected in all layers of the DLPFC and in all neuronal subregions of the hippocampal formation, however CTNNA1 mRNA, coding for an 'epithelial' specific catenin, was not detected in any region of the cortex or hippocampus. CTNNA2, a 'neuronal-specific' catenin, and CTNNB1 mRNAs were abundant in both DLPFC and hippocampus, with a distinct neuronal localization. CTNNA2 mRNA was concentrated in both granular/stellate cells and large pyramidal cell bodies, while CTNNB1 expression was more strongly associated with granular cell bodies throughout the DLPFC, with expression in pyramidal cells confined mainly to cortical Layers III and VI. CTNNA2 and CTNNB1 mRNAs were also abundant in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn, apparently co-expressed in the same neurons. JUP mRNA was rather diffusely localized in the DLPFC without the distinct laminar patterns seen for CTNNA2 and CTNNB1 but was distinctly localized in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn. These studies demonstrate a distinct neuronal pattern of gene expression for catenin family members in primate brain structures characterized by high degrees of folding and strong lamination. The high level expression of these transcripts supports the notion of a major role for catenins even in the adult brain. Such an understanding is also important in view of the multiple interactions that catenins have with many other proteins in the adult and ageing brain. This may also have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as emerging neuronal stem cell therapies.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In this study we have shown, by in situ hybridization and RNase protection assay, a significant trkC mRNA increase confined to the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, both after seizures induced by intracerebroventricular injection of kainic acid and bicuculline. Moreover, after bicuculline treatment we observed an earlier increase of trkC mRNA level, which peaked after 3 h and returned back to normal levels by 12 h. In contrast, the kainic acid treatment produced a delayed increase of trkC mRNA, which initiated after 6 h, peaked at 12 h, and returned to normal levels at 24 h. This increase, which involves also trkC mRNA receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, was mediated by non-NMDA receptors and counteracted by GABA potentiating agent diazepam. Using embryonic neuronal cultures from cerebral hemispheres, including hippocampus, we found that glutamate receptor agonists, including glutamate, kainate, NMDA, and t-ACPD, increase trkC mRNA levels with the following rank order of efficacy: NMDA > t-ACPD > kainic acid > glutamate. In conclusion, our data show that trkC mRNA expression in granule cells of the hippocampus dentate gyrus is increased during seizure activity and that it is mediated by non-NMDA receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Adult neurogenesis, the process of generating mature neurons from adult neural stem cells, proceeds concurrently with ongoing neuronal circuit activity and is modulated by various physiological and pathological stimuli. The niche mechanism underlying the activity-dependent regulation of the sequential steps of adult neurogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report that neuronal activity decreases the expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), a naturally secreted Wnt inhibitor highly expressed by adult dentate gyrus granule neurons. Sfrp3 deletion activates quiescent radial neural stem cells and promotes newborn neuron maturation, dendritic growth, and dendritic spine formation in the adult mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, sfrp3 reduction is essential for activity-induced adult neural progenitor proliferation and the acceleration of new neuron development. Our study identifies sFRP3 as an inhibitory niche factor from local mature dentate granule neurons that regulates multiple phases of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggests an interesting activity-dependent mechanism governing adult neurogenesis via the acute release of tonic inhibition.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The docking protein p62Dok-1 (Dok-1) has a central role in cell signaling mediated by a wide range of protein tyrosine kinases, including intrinsic membrane kinases, such as the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor. To elucidate potential IGF signaling mechanisms, we used DNA array technology to investigate novel kinase targets expressed in the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Dok-1 transcripts were among the most abundant found in this structure. Because Dok-1 expression has not been characterized in brain, we evaluated its expression pattern using immunoblotting, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry in the rhesus monkey prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation. Dok-1 antibodies identified a 62-kDa band in lysates from the DLPFC, consistent with the known size for Dok-1. In situ hybridization showed that Dok-1 mRNA was expressed in all layers of the DLPFC and in all neuronal subregions of the hippocampal formation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed Dok-1 immunoreactivity concentrated in pyramidal neurons of cortical layers IV-V and throughout Ammon's horn and in granule neurons of the dentate gyrus. Dok-1 expression was also identified in endothelial cells of cerebral blood vessels. These expression patterns are very similar to those of the IGF-1 receptor and suggest that Dok-1 could be among the downstream targets of IGF signaling in areas of the primate brain involved in learning and memory.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Kainic acid-induced seizures, in adult rats produce neurodegeneration in the hippocampus followed by sprouting of the mossy fibres in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and changes in GAP-43 expression in the granule cells. In the present study we observed that 4 days after kainic acid injection a dense plexus of silver-impregnated degenerating terminals detected by Gallyas's method and a decrease of GAP-43 immunostaining was observed in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus indicating deafferentiation of this region. This was associated with the formation of an intense GAP-43 immunostained band in the supragranular layer. MK-801, a non-competitive inhibitor of the NMDA receptor, which partially inhibited the behavioural seizures induced by KA, also protected from the inner molecular layer deafferentation and markedly reduced the expression of GAP-43 mRNA in the granule cells and the intense GAP-43 immunostained band in the supragranular layer, suggesting a relationship among these events. Two months after kainic acid injection the intense supragranular GAP-43 positive band was no longer evident but the whole inner molecular layer appeared more labelled in association with the formation of the collateral sprouting of the mossy fibres in the inner molecular layer as detected by Timm's staining. These effects were also markedly reduced by the pretreatment with MK-801. Taken together, these experiments indicate for the first time a direct relationship between the increase of GAP-43 immunostaining in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the collateral sprouting of mossy fibres in this district in response to kainic acid induced seizures. This further supports the hypothesis that the early induction of GAP-43 in granule cells may be one of the molecular mechanisms required for the synaptic reorganization of the mossy fibres.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Transient downregulation of Sema3A mRNA in a rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. A novel molecular event potentially contributing to mossy fiber sprouting.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is thought to play a critical role in the hyperexcitability of the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy patients. The composition of molecular signals that is needed to direct this sprouting response has not yet been elucidated to a great extent. In the present study we investigated the expression profile of Sema3A mRNA and the axonal growth-associated protein GAP-43 mRNA during the process of electrically induced epileptogenesis in rats. Sema3A is an axon guidance molecule with repellent activity on dentate granule cell axons. It is produced by neurons in the entorhinal cortex, which synapse on the dendrites of dentate granule cells. Upregulation of GAP-43 expression in granule cells has often been reported in conjunction with MFS. After induction of status epilepticus, the expression of Sema3A mRNA was temporarily downregulated in the entorhinal cortex concomitantly with an upregulation of GAP-43 mRNA in dentate granule cells. In the following days, robust MFS into the dentate molecular layer was observed. When the induction of status epilepticus was incomplete the two responses appeared to dissociate, i.e., the downregulation of Sema3A mRNA did not occur, while upregulation of GAP-43 mRNA in dentate granule cells was still displayed. However, in these rats no significant MFS was observed. These findings indicate that Sema3A mRNA downregulation is temporarily correlated with MFS, while GAP-43 upregulation per se is not, and suggest that a loss of Sema3A in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus could facilitate MFS into this area during epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The functions of type II diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) δ and -η in the brain are still unclear. As a first step, we investigated the spatial and temporal expression of DGKδ and -η in the brains of mice. DGKδ2, but not DGKδ1, was highly expressed in layers II-VI of the cerebral cortex; CA-CA3 regions and dentate gyrus of hippocampus; mitral cell, glomerular and granule cell layers of the olfactory bulb; and the granule cell layer in the cerebellum in 1- to 32-week-old mice. DGKδ2 was expressed just after birth, and its expression levels dramatically increased from weeks 1 to 4. A substantial amount of DGKη (η1/η2) was detected in layers II-VI of the cerebral cortex, CA1 and CA2 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, mitral cell and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of 1- to 32-week-old mice. DGKη2 expression reached maximum levels at P5 and decreased by 4 weeks, whereas DGKη1 increased over the same time frame. These results indicate that the expression patterns of DGK isozymes differ from each other and also from other isozymes, and this suggests that DGKδ and -η play distinct and specific roles in the brain.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential regulation of adult and embryonic glutamate decarboxylases in rat dentate granule cells after kainate-induced limbic seizures.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In adult brain, the inhibitory GABAergic neurons utilize two distinct molecular forms of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), GAD65 and GAD67. During embryonic development, two truncated forms of GAD67 are also expressed (GAD25 and GAD44), which are translated from two embryonic-specific splice variants of GAD67 messenger RNA. It has recently been established that the excitatory dentate granule cells, in addition to the neurotransmitter glutamate, also contain low levels of GABA and GAD67, which are increased after limbic seizures. To study the seizure-induced activation of glutamate decarboxylase, we investigated the expression of both embryonic and adult glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNAs in the adult rat hippocampus after kainic acid administration by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization and immunoblotting. We observed a rapid induction of the embryonic glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA in the granule cells of dentate gyrus. The expression of embryonic glutamate decarboxylase transcripts, identified here as the splice variant that contains exon 7/B, peaked at about 2h after kainic acid injection and gradually returned to nearly basal levels by 24h. Strikingly, this transient induction of embryonic glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA was not accompanied by concomitant synthesis of its corresponding protein product GAD25. In contrast, the adult GAD67 messenger RNA and protein were both clearly up-regulated in granule cells, albeit with a certain delay, reaching a maximum around 4-6h after kainic acid injection and gradually returned to control levels by 24h. GAD65 remained unchanged at both messenger RNA and protein levels during the studied period. These characteristic and highly reproducible changes in the synthesis of glutamate decarboxylases indicate that GAD67 is the predominant form of glutamate decarboxylases involved in the elevated synthesis of GABA during seizures and suggest that the transient induction of the embryonic GAD67 messenger RNA that contains exon 7/B, but not GAD25 protein, may exert a role solely in the subsequent up-regulation of adult GAD67 transcription. Expression of the messenger RNA encoding for an alternatively spliced, truncated form of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase was detected in dentate granule cells briefly after kainic acid-induced seizures. Just as during embryonic development, expression of the alternatively spliced messenger RNA was transient and followed by transcription of its adult form, indicating a possible recapitulation of an embryonic program of gene expression in adult granule cells after epileptic seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The regulation and specificity of the interactions between the proteins involved in neurotransmitter release are obvious targets for the cellular control of synaptic plasticity. Previous research has identified one of these proteins, syntaxin 1B, as a potential target for mediating the propagation of synaptic plasticity through neural networks. The expression of syntaxin 1B is modified in the hippocampus after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and during learning. Here, we describe the identification of two other members of the syntaxin family from rat brain, syntaxins 3A and 3B, and show that they are generated from the same gene by alternate splicing. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining confirm the expression of syntaxins 3A and 3B in the adult rat brain. The transcripts and proteins show a lower abundance but a similar pattern of expression as syntaxins 1A and 1 B. By using quantitative competitive PCR, we show that the mRNAs that encode syntaxins 1B and 3A are increased in dentate granule cells 6 h after the induction of LTP in vivo, whereas syntaxin 3B mRNA is decreased as rapidly as 30 min, and lasts for at least 6 h, after the induction of LTP. These findings identify coordinated changes in the expression of several syntaxin isoforms with different substrate specificities and suggest that regulation of the splicing machinery by LTP induction is one of the diverse strategies used during the long-term modification of the synapse in the vertebrate nervous system.',\n",

We investigated expression of neuropeptide Y Y2 receptors after TMT intoxication. Markedly elevated (by 470%) concentrations of Y2 receptor mRNA were found in the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate granule cell layer after 5 days. Increases in the infrapyramidal blade were less prominent (by 198%). After 16 days, mRNA levels in both blades of the granule cell layer showed no significant difference from those in controls. Quantification of Y2 receptor-specific binding revealed no significant change at both 5 and 16 days after TMT intoxication. It is suggested, together with a previous report describing a similar increase of neuropeptide Y expression, that a transient expression of Y2 receptors in the dentate gyrus in the initial phase of TMT intoxication may be involved in mediating TMT-induced hippocampal damage.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Loss of hippocampal neurons as a result of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is thought to contribute to the observed spatial memory deficits. Using a rodent model of experimental brain injury, we have examined the nature of hippocampal cell death following TBI. Light microscope examination of stained sections showed the presence of a large number of hyperchromatic and dystrophic neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These cells appeared to be undergoing nuclear condensation. Electron microscope examination demonstrated the presence of cell shrinkage, condensed chromatin, nuclear segmentation, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Detection of a DNA ladder and in situ labeling (TUNEL) were also consistent with the process of apoptosis. However, in some dystrophic neurons these morphologies were also accompanied by the presence of swollen mitochondria and a lack of distinctive rough endoplasmic reticulum which are typically associated with necrosis. These findings show that cortical impact injury produces cell death in the hippocampus which has both apoptotic and necrotic features.',\n",

Furthermore, there were positive correlations between dysbindin-1 mRNA and expression of synaptic markers known to be reduced in schizophrenia.

Pretreatment of rats with D-amino-phosphonovalerate (D-APV, 10 micrograms), a selective antagonist of NMDA receptor, prevented the behavioral and biochemical changes evoked by NMDA.

Reelin, which is synthesized and secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the neocortex and hippocampus, is proposed to act as a stop signal for migrating neurons. Here we show that a decreased expression of reelin mRNA by hippocampal Cajal-Retzius cells correlates with the extent of migration defects in the dentate gyrus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. These results suggest that reelin is required for normal neuronal lamination in humans, and that deficient reelin expression may be involved in migration defects associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution and extent of glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) mRNA-labeled neurons that coexpress pre-prosomatostatin mRNA were studied in the rat dentate gyrus of the dorsal and ventral hippocampal formation. The distribution of each group of neurons was determined initially by nonradioactive in situ hybridization experiments with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for GAD65 mRNA and pre-prosomatostatin mRNA. Double labeling experiments were then conducted with digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for GAD65 mRNA and 35S-labeled riboprobes for pre-prosomatostatin mRNA. In the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus, GAD65 mRNA-containing neurons were highly concentrated in the hilus and in the innermost part of the granule cell layer whereas only a few labeled neurons were scattered in the molecular layer. Pre-prosomatostatin mRNA-containing neurons were primarily located in the hilus and were virtually absent from the molecular and granule cell layers. The simultaneous detection of GAD65 and pre-prosomatostatin mRNAs in the same sections showed that the vast majority of pre-prosomatostatin mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus were also labeled for GAD65 mRNA. In contrast many GAD65 mRNA-labeled neurons did not contain pre-prosomatostatin mRNA. These included all neurons in the molecular layer, neurons within the inner granule cell layer and neurons interspersed amongst double labeled neurons in the hilus. Quantitative analyses indicated that a very high percentage of hilar pre-prosomatostatin mRNA-containing neurons coexpressed GAD65 mRNA in the dorsal (96%) and ventral (92%) dentate gyrus. In contrast only a part of the total population of hilar GAD65 mRNA-containing neurons were also labeled for pre-prosomatostatin mRNA in the dorsal (43%) and ventral (53%) dentate gyrus. In the CA3c region, the percentages of neurons containing both mRNAs were similar to those observed in the hilus. The findings demonstrate that the vast majority of hilar somatostatin neurons, which have previously been shown to be extremely vulnerable to ischemia and seizure-induced damage, are GABA neurons. However, the total population of GAD65 mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus is substantially larger than the somatostatin-containing subgroup, and these findings reinforce the suggestion that GABA neurons are a major component of the diverse group of neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Bone morphogenetic proteins belong to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily and act through serine/threonine kinase type I and type II receptors such as bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I and type II. In order to further understand the roles that these factors exert in the nervous system, we have examined the expression pattern of seven bone morphogenetic proteins and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I and II transcripts in the brain and spinal cord of rodent. Whereas bone morphogenetic protein receptor type I expression was low in rat brain, in situ hybridization studies performed with specific digoxigenin-labelled riboprobes revealed the presence of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II-positive cells throughout the brain, with a notable localization in dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II transcripts were also expressed by large motoneuron-like cells located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and by sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia. In addition, we observed a significant up-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus 48 h after transient global cerebral ischemia in rat suggesting that modulation of this receptor intervenes during neuronal plasticity or repair that occur upon brain injury. Among the potential ligands for this receptor, bone morphogenetic protein-6 and bone morphogenetic protein-7 were expressed in meninges and the choroid plexus, while bone morphogenetic protein-4-expressing cells were spatially and temporally regulated in myelinated structures during development and in the adult suggesting its expression in oligodendrocytes. These data clearly indicate that besides their roles in bone and embryonic tissues, bone morphogenetic proteins and their receptors may have also important functions in adult neural tissues.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus persists throughout life and is increased by seizures. The dentate granule cell (DGC) layer is often abnormal in human and experimental temporal lobe epilepsy, with dispersion of the layer and the appearance of ectopic granule neurons in the hilus. We tested the hypothesis that these abnormalities result from aberrant DGC neurogenesis after seizure-induced injury. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify proliferating progenitors and mature DGCs in the adult rat pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy model. We also examined dentate gyri from epileptic human hippocampal surgical specimens. Prox-1 immunohistochemistry and pulse-chase bromodeoxyuridine labeling showed that progenitors migrate aberrantly to the hilus and molecular layer after prolonged seizures and differentiate into ectopic DGCs in rat. Neuroblast marker expression indicated the delayed appearance of chainlike progenitor cell formations extending into the hilus and molecular layer, suggesting that seizures alter migratory behavior of DGC precursors. Ectopic putative DGCs also were found in the hilus and molecular layer of epileptic human dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that seizure-induced abnormalities of neuroblast migration lead to abnormal integration of newborn DGCs in the epileptic adult hippocampus, and implicate aberrant neurogenesis in the development or progression of recurrent seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We previously demonstrated that chemokine receptors are expressed by neural progenitors grown as cultured neurospheres. To examine the significance of these findings for neural progenitor function in vivo, we investigated whether chemokine receptors were expressed by cells having the characteristics of neural progenitors in neurogenic regions of the postnatal brain. Using in situ hybridization we demonstrated the expression of CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4 chemokine receptors by cells in the dentate gyrus (DG), subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, and olfactory bulb. The pattern of expression for all of these receptors was similar, including regions where neural progenitors normally reside. In addition, we attempted to colocalize chemokine receptors with markers for neural progenitors. In order to do this we used nestin-EGFP and TLX-LacZ transgenic mice, as well as labeling for Ki67, a marker for dividing cells. In all three areas of the brain we demonstrated colocalization of chemokine receptors with these three markers in populations of cells. Expression of chemokine receptors by neural progenitors was further confirmed using CXCR4-EGFP BAC transgenic mice. Expression of CXCR4 in the DG included cells that expressed nestin and GFAP as well as cells that appeared to be immature granule neurons expressing PSA-NCAM, calretinin, and Prox-1. CXCR4-expressing cells in the DG were found in close proximity to immature granule neurons that expressed the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12. Cells expressing CXCR4 frequently coexpressed CCR2 receptors. These data support the hypothesis that chemokine receptors are important in regulating the migration of progenitor cells in postnatal brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'NAPOR-3 is a central nervous system RNA binding protein that is associated with downstream mRNA targets and has been demonstrated to be selectively overexpressed during apoptotic cell death. In this study, we first examined the regional distribution of NAPOR-3 mRNA in the adult rat brain by in situ hybridization: the transcript was abundantly expressed in many brain regions, mostly in gray matter, including the CA1-CA4 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the piriform cortex and the cerebellar granule cell layer. We then investigated the role of NAPOR-3 in neuronal cell death by monitoring its mRNA and protein expression levels using semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. NAPOR-3 was overexpressed in rat organotypic slices exposed to staurosporine and to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of apoptotic cerebral ischemia, but not when exposed to glutamate toxicity. Our results also demonstrate that NAPOR-3 gene overexpression is an early step in the chain of signaling events leading to apoptosis, taking place upstream of caspase-3 activation. Finally, antisense-mediated downregulation of NAPOR-3 gene expression protected hippocampal cultures against OGD-induced apoptosis and prevented caspase-3 activation. Our results demonstrate that NAPOR-3 gene overexpression is necessary for the execution of OGD-induced programmed cell death.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Increased neurosteroid sensitivity of hippocampal GABAA receptors during postnatal development.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'To investigate developmental changes in neurosteroid modulation of GABA(A) receptors, whole-cell currents were elicited by applying GABA with allopregnanolone or pregnenolone sulfate (PS) to dentate granule cells (DGCs), acutely isolated from 7-14-day-old and adult rats. GABA evoked larger currents from dentate granule cells acutely isolated from adult rats (adult DGCs) than from neonatal DGCs, due to increased efficacy (1662+/-267 pA in adult DGCs versus 1094+/-198 pA in neonatal DGCs, P=0.004), and current density (0.072+/-0.01 pA/microm(2) in neonatal rat DGCs to 0.178+/-0.02 pA/microm(2) in adult DGCs), but unchanged potency (EC(50) was 18.5+/-2 microm in adult DGCs, and 26.6+/-7.9 microm in neonatal DGCs, P=0.21). Allopregnanolone sensitivity of GABA(A) receptor currents increased during development due to an increased potency (21.1+/-4.7 nM in adult DGCs versus 94.6+/-9 nM in neonatal DGCs, P=0.0002). The potency and efficacy of PS inhibition of GABA(A) receptor currents were remained unchanged during development (13+/-6 microm and 13.2+/-5.9 microm, P=0.71 and 85.5%+/-3.5% and 83.6%+/-0.8%, P=0.29, respectively). To investigate possible mechanism of developmental changes in GABA(A) receptor properties, in situ hybridization for alpha1, alpha4 and gamma2 subunit mRNAs was performed in dentate gyrus of the two age groups. Qualitatively, alpha1 subunit mRNA was expressed at low levels in neonatal rats while it was well expressed in adult rats. The alpha4 and gamma2 subunits were well expressed in the dentate gyrus of adult and neonatal rats. Immunohistochemical staining for alpha1 subunit in hippocampal slices from neonatal and adult rats was examined under confocal laser scanning microscope. This demonstrated that cell bodies and dendrites of granule cells are moderately positive for the alpha1 staining in adult rats but weakly so in neonatal rats. Higher-magnification images demonstrate large number of clusters of alpha1-subunit in the cell bodies of dentate granule cells of adult rat but rare clusters in granule cells of neonatal rats. Maturation of GABA(A) receptors in DGCs is characterized by increased number of GABA(A) receptors that are more sensitive to endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone, which might be related to increased expression of alpha1 subunit.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure-induced damage in a model of chronic seizures. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine-induced seizures. In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a digoxigenin-labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine-treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals. Additional neuronanatomical studies, including cresyl violet staining, neuronal degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels. The loss of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer. Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals. No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer. The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure-induced damage. Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of GABA neurons.',\n",

The group I mGluR antagonist 4-CPG (200 nmol) inhibited the action of (1S,3R)ACPD.

       "  'Abstract': \"Synaptopodin, a 100 kD protein, associated with the actin cytoskeleton of the postsynaptic density and dendritic spines, is thought to play a role in modulating actin-based shape and motility of dendritic spines during formation or elimination of synaptic contacts. Temporal lobe epilepsy in humans and in rats shows neuronal damage, aberrant sprouting of hippocampal mossy fibers and subsequent synaptic remodeling processes. Using kainic acid (KA) induced epilepsy in rats, the postictal hippocampal expression of synaptopodin was analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry. Sprouting of mossy fibers was visualized by a modified Timm's staining. ISH showed elevated levels of Synaptopodin mRNA in perikarya of CA3 principal neurons, dentate granule cells and in surviving hilar neurons these levels persisted up to 8 weeks after seizure induction. Synaptopodin immunoreactivity in the dendritic layers of CA3, in the hilus and in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) was initially reduced. Eight weeks after KA treatment Synaptopodin protein expression returned to control levels in dendritic layers of CA3 and in the entire molecular layer of the DG. The recovery of protein expression was accompanied by simultaneous supra- and infragranular mossy fiber sprouting. Postictal upregulation of Synaptopodin mRNA levels in target cell populations of limbic epilepsy-elicited damage and subsequent Synaptopodin protein expression largely co-localized with remodeling processes as demonstrated by mossy fiber sprouting. It may thus represent a novel postsynaptic molecular correlate of hippocampal neuroplasticity.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We isolated a rat orphan nuclear hormone receptor from a brain cortex cDNA library. The sequence of the cDNA insert was 2154 bp with an open reading frame of 1794 bp encoding a putative protein of 598 amino acids and predicted molecular mass of 65 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a strong homology to the mouse nurr1 and human NOT1 orphan nuclear hormone receptors of the NGFI-B/nur77/NAK1 gene subfamily. We refer to this rat clone as r-nurr1. Northern blot analysis showed that r-nurr1 mRNA was highly expressed in the brain and moderately in the lung as a 4.0 kb transcript. A smaller transcript of 2.5 kb was also detected in the testes. The level of r-nurr1 transcript in the heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney and spleen was marginal. In situ hybridization showed that r-nurr1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in various regions of the CNS, particularly in the deeper layers (IV to VI) of the perirhinal cortex and area 2 of parietal cortex. We further evaluated the modulation of r-nurr1 expression in CNS by an electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) and by an amgydala-kindled seizure. A single ECS administered via earclip electrodes induced a rapid and transient increase of r-nurr1 mRNA in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, being significant at 15 min after the seizure, maximal approximately 1 h and back to baseline at 4 h. The amygdala kindled seizure revealed a less robust and restricted nurr-1 induction in the CNS, as only two of the four kindled animals showed a unilateral induction of nurr1 mRNA in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that r-nurr1 is an immediate-early gene that is differentially induced by ECS vs. kindled seizures. In addition, as r-nurr1 is prominently expressed in the specific brain sites associated with memory acquisition and consolidation, it may play a role in memory processing.',\n",

In situ hybridization confirmed that hippocampal transcripts of HCN1, but not HCN2/3/4, are down-regulated after ECL. Expression recovered at approximately 21 days after lesion (dal). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a corresponding regulation of HCN1 protein expression in CA1-CA3 dendrites, hilar mossy cells and interneurons, and granule cells. Patch-clamp recordings in the early phase after lesion from mossy cells and hilar interneurons revealed an increase in the fast time constant of current activation and a profound negative shift in voltage activation of Ih. Whereas current activation recovered at 30 dal, the voltage activation remained hyperpolarized in mossy cells and hilar interneurons. Granule cells, however, were devoid of any detectable somatic Ih currents. Hence, denervation of the hippocampus decreases HCN1 and concomitantly the Ih activity in hilar neurons, and the recovery of h-current activation kinetics occurs parallel to postlesion sprouting.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Epilepsy is closely related to an altered transmission of GABA, the major inhibitory transmitter in the brain. GABA acts through two classes of receptors, ionotropic GABA(A) receptors and metabotropic GABA(B) receptors. Using in situ hybridization, receptor autoradiography and immunocytochemistry, we now investigated temporal changes in the expression the GABA(B)-1 and GABA(B)-2 subunits (GABA(B)-1R and GABA(B)-1R, respectively) in the hippocampus following kainic-acid-induced seizures. Significant decreases (by about 40%) in mRNA levels of both splice variants (a and b) of GABA(B)-1R and of GABA(B)-2R were observed in the principal cell layer of the hippocampus 6-12 h after kainic acid injection in the rat. Whereas mRNA levels in the granule cell layer returned to basal after 24 h, the decreases persisted in sectors CA1 and CA3, presumably due to progressing neurodegeneration. In the sector CA3, GABA(B)-R mRNA levels and GABA(B)-R1 immunoreactivity partially recovered 30 days after the initial kainic acid seizures indicating receptor upregulation in surviving neurons.',\n",

The regional expression pattern of PAM in brains has not been yet been defined. Expression patterns of PAM in both rat and mouse brains were examined by using in situ hybridization. Here, we demonstrate that PAM mRNA is highly expressed in specific anatomical regions including hippocampus, dentate gyrus and cerebellum. In these areas, PAM mRNA is restricted to pyramidal cells of hippocampus and granule cells of dentate gyrus and cerebellum. During development, PAM mRNA expression is differentially regulated. It is turned on after birth and up-regulated during the first postnatal 2 weeks. Thereafter, PAM mRNA expression remains elevated into adulthood. The regional distribution of PAM in brain is similar to that observed for several adenylyl cyclase isoforms such as type I isoform. However, no obvious alterations of PAM mRNA expression are detected in brains of mice deficient in type I or type 8 or type 1 and type 8 isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. Thus, adenylyl cyclase does not appear to alter the expression of PAM.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurogenesis-the generation of new neurons-is an ongoing process that persists in the adult mammalian brain of several species, including humans. In this work we analyze two discrete brain regions: the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the walls of the lateral ventricles; and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in mice and shed light on the SVZ and SGZ specific neurogenesis. We propose a computational model that relies on the construction and analysis of region specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from the publicly available data on these two regions. Using this model a number of putative factors involved in neuronal stem cell (NSC) identity and maintenance were identified. We also demonstrate potential gender and niche-derived differences based on cell surface and nuclear receptors via Ar, Hif1a, and Nr3c1. We have also conducted cell fate determinant analysis for SVZ NSC populations to Olfactory Bulb interneurons and SGZ NSC populations to the granule cells of the Granular Cell Layer. We report 31 candidate cell fate determinant gene pairs, ready to be validated. We focus on Ar-Pax6 in SVZ and Sox2-Ncor1 in SGZ. Both pairs are expressed and localized in the suggested anatomical structures as shown by in situ hybridization and found to physically interact. Finally, we conclude that there are fundamental differences between SGZ and SVZ neurogenesis. We argue that these regulatory mechanisms are linked to the observed differential neurogenic potential of these regions. The presence of nuclear and cell surface receptors in the region specific regulatory circuits indicate the significance of niche derived extracellular factors, hormones and region specific factors such as the oxygen sensitivity, dictating SGZ and SVZ specific neurogenesis.

In order to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the synthesis of dynorphin in the hippocampus, we have established a routine primary cell culture of dentate granule neurons and identified granule-like neurons by a characteristic marker, dynorphin, in these cultures. Cultures were prepared from 7-day-old rat pups and maintained in medium with 2% fetal bovine serum. These cultures contained approximately 20% neurons and survived for over 4 weeks. After 2 weeks in culture, neurons expressing dynorphin-A and its messenger RNA were detected using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. In dentate cultures, enkephalin-, cholecystokinin-, neuropeptide Y- and substance P-positive cells were observed in addition to dynorphin-positive cells with immunocytochemistry. The results suggest that dentate gyrus cell cultures provide a valid in vitro model for studying molecular mechanisms regulating prodynorphin gene expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': ['The cerebellum is thought to be involved in cognitive functions in addition to its well established role in motor coordination and motor learning in humans. Cerebellin 1 (Cbln1) is predominantly expressed in cerebellar granule cells and plays a crucial role in the formation and function of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. Although genes encoding Cbln1 and its postsynaptic receptor, the delta2 glutamate receptor (GluD2), are suggested to be associated with autistic-like traits and many psychiatric disorders, whether such cognitive impairments are caused by cerebellar dysfunction remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether and how Cbln1 signaling is involved in non-motor functions in adult mice. We show that acquisition and retention/retrieval of cued and contextual fear memory were impaired in Cbln1-null mice. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Cbln1 is expressed in various extracerebellar regions, including the retrosplenial granular cortex and the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, Cbln1 immunoreactivity was present at the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum lacunosum-moleculare without overt mRNA expression, suggesting that Cbln1 is provided by perforant path fibers. Retention/retrieval, but not acquisition, of cued and contextual fear memory was impaired in forebrain-predominant Cbln1-null mice. Spatial learning in the radial arm water maze was also abrogated. In contrast, acquisition of fear memory was affected in cerebellum-predominant Cbln1-null mice. These results indicate that Cbln1 in the forebrain and cerebellum mediates specific aspects of fear conditioning and spatial memory differentially and that Cbln1 signaling likely regulates motor and non-motor functions in multiple brain regions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA can be regulated in vitro and in vivo in the hippocampal formation by events associated with pharmacological activation of glutamate receptors. In the present study, the level of NGF mRNA in the hippocampal formation was examined following an intrahippocampal injection of 1 nmole fluorocitrate, which temporarily inhibits the astrocyte metabolic activity in vivo. Consistent with previous findings, fluorocitrate treatment significantly increased glutamate levels and decreased glutamine levels in the dentate gyrus as determined by in vivo microdialysis. The increased ratio of glutamate to glutamine was followed by a significant increase in NGF mRNA expression selectively in dentate gyrus granule cells. The effects of increasing glutamate levels were blocked by pretreatment with 50 nmole 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP5), a competitive antagonist that acts at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor subtype. These findings suggest that NGF mRNA expression is regulated, in part, by changes in endogenous glutamate levels, partially through enhanced excitatory neurotransmission through NMDA receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The expression of the transcription factor c-JUN was investigated in the rat fascia dentata under normal conditions and after entorhinal cortex lesion. As shown by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry c-JUN and its messenger RNA are present in the principal cell layers of the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn (except hippocampal region CA2). Pre-embedding immunogold electron microscopy revealed an almost exclusive nuclear localization of c-JUN, where it is associated with chromatin. In addition, double immunolabelling for c-JUN and parvalbumin demonstrated that c-JUN immunoreactivity is primarily found in principal neurons since GABAergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons did not express c-JUN. After unilateral electrolytic lesion of the entorhinal cortex c-JUN was strongly up-regulated in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus within 2 h postlesion. This up-regulation was also present in the contralateral fascia dentata 12 h after entorhinal cortex lesion and returned to control levels on both sides 24 h postlesion. The cellular distribution of c-JUN did not change after entorhinal cortex lesion: parvalbumin-positive interneurons never contained c-JUN. These results point to a specific role of c-JUN in the granule cells of the fascia dentata in the normal animal and in rats with entorhinal cortex lesions. The selective induction of c-JUN after entorhinal lesion could be one of the first molecular steps that regulate transneuronal changes within granule cells after their denervation. A different mechanism has to be assumed for GABAergic interneurons known to receive an entorhinal innervation as well.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The activity of HCO(3)(-) transporters contributes to the acid-base environment of the nervous system. In the present study, we used in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold electron microscopy to localize electrogenic Na/bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1 splice variants (-A, -B, and -C) in rat brain. The in situ hybridization data are consistent with NBCe1-B and -C, but not -A, being the predominant NBCe1 variants in brain, particularly in the cerebellum, hippocampus, piriform cortex, and olfactory bulb. An antisense probe to the B and C variants strongly labeled granule neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and cells in the granule layer and Purkinje layer (e.g. Bergmann glia) of the cerebellum. Weaker labeling was observed in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and in astrocytes throughout the brain. Similar, but weaker labeling was obtained with an antisense probe to the A and B variants. In immunoblot studies, antibodies to the A and B variants (alphaA/B) and C variant (alphaC) labeled approximately 130-kDa proteins in various brain regions. From immunohistochemistry data, both alphaA/B and alphaC exhibited diffuse labeling throughout brain, but alphaA/B labeling was more intracellular and punctate. Based on co-localization studies with antibodies to neuronal or astrocytic markers, alphaA/B labeled neurons in the pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, as well as cortex. alphaC labeled glia surrounding neurons (and possibly neurons) in the neuropil of the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cell layer and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and the cortex. According to electron microscopy data from the cerebellum, alphaA/B primarily labeled neurons intracellularly and alphaC labeled astrocytes at the plasma membrane. In summary, the B and C variants are the predominant NBCe1 variants in rat brain and exhibit different localization profiles.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study was designed to isolate new genes related to apoptosis in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and to characterize the roles of the genes using both in vitro and in vivo models of oxidative injury. cDNA libraries were prepared from H2O2-treated and -untreated PC12 cells, and a ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9) clone was isolated by a differential screening method. Increase of RPS9 expression in both H2O2-treated PC12 and neuroblastoma (Neuro-2A) cells was shown by Northern blot analysis. Viability of the antisense-transfected Neuro-2A (RPS9-AS) cells following H2O2 treatment was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. In an in vivo model of transient forebrain ischemia, an increase in RPS9 expression was prominent by 1 day postischemia in the granule cell layer neurons of the dentate gyrus. Both activation of caspase-3 and significant recovery of viability following pretreatment with cycloheximide were shown in RPS9-AS cells treated with H2O2. These data suggest that RPS9 plays a protective role in oxidative injury of neuronal cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The multidrug resistance (mdr) P-glycoprotein is an energy-dependent efflux transporter that protects the brain against a wide variety of neurotoxic compounds. This transmembrane protein is a well-known functional component of the blood-brain barrier and might be present in other brain cells as well. We have developed a riboprobe against the murine mdr1 mRNA recognizing both isoforms of the rodent mdr1 gene to determine the exact localization of P-glycoprotein expression. We have also studied the effects of treatment with a known inducer of P-glycoprotein expression. In situ mRNA hybridization demonstrates that mdr1 mRNA is present in the endothelial cells of brain capillaries throughout the rat brain, indicating that P-glycoprotein is expressed at the endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. Surprisingly, specific mdr1 mRNA expression was also found in neuronal layers of hippocampal fields, particularly in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Kainic acid treatment decreased the expression levels of mdr1 mRNA in the dentate gyrus 6 and 24 h after treatment. Our data indicate that P-glycoprotein is expressed by endothelial cells and possibly dentate gyrus neurons The functional role of P-glycoprotein at dentate gyrus neurons is presently unknown.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution of glutamate transporters in the hippocampus of patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), increased extracellular glutamate levels in the epileptogenic hippocampus both during and after clinical seizures have been reported. These increased glutamate levels could be the result of malfunctioning and/or downregulation of glutamate transporters (also known as EAATs; excitatory amino acid transporters). In this study, the distribution of protein and mRNA of EAAT subtypes was examined in the hippocampus of TLE patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS group) and without hippocampal sclerosis (non-HS group), and in autopsy controls without neurological disorders. EAAT protein localization was studied by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections using specific poly- and monoclonal antibodies against the glial glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 and the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3. Antibody specificity was shown by immunoblotting. In the HS group, a small decrease in EAAT1-immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in CA4 and in the polymorphic and supragranular layer of the dentate gyrus, compared with the control group. The strongest changes were found for EAAT2 levels. In the non-HS group, increased EAAT2-IR was detected in the CA1 and CA2 field, compared with non-epileptic controls. EAAT2-IR was decreased in the HS compared with the non-HS group. Fewer EAAT3-positive cells were found in the HS group than in the non-HS and control group. In both TLE groups, increased EAAT3 levels were observed in individual neurones. In the HS group, the percentage of EAAT3-IR neurones was increased in CA2 and in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Radioactive in situ hybridization for EAAT1-3 confirmed our immunohistochemical results. Non-radioactive in situ hybridization showed that not only astrocytes, but also neurones express EAAT2 mRNA. Taken together, differences in both mRNA and protein levels of glutamate transporter subtypes were found in specific regions in the TLE hippocampus, with most severe changes found for EAAT2 and EAAT3 levels. The results indicate an upregulation of EAAT2 protein expression in CA1 and CA2 in neurones in the non-HS group. This is in line with decreased EAAT2 protein levels in the HS group, since these hippocampi are characterized by severe neuronal cell loss. The functional consequences (glutamate transport capacity) of the reported changes in EAAT2 and EAAT3 remain to be determined.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus are extensively reinnervated following the destruction of their normal inputs from the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex (EC). The present study evaluates gene expression by dentate granule neurons and the neurons giving rise to the sprouting connections during the period of synapse growth. Adult male rats were prepared for in situ hybridization at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, and 30 days following unilateral EC lesions. Sections were hybridized using 35S-labeled cRNA probes for mRNAs that encode proteins thought to be important for neuronal structure and/or synapse function, including (1) mRNAs that are normally present in dendrites--the mRNAs for the high molecular weight microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and the alpha-subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMII kinase), (2) mRNAs that are upregulated in neurons that are regenerating their axons (T alpha 1 tubulin and F1/GAP43) and (3) mRNAs for proteins that are the principal constituents of neurofilaments and microtubules (the low molecular weight neurofilament protein NF68 and beta-tubulin). Although there were small changes in the levels of labeling for the mRNAs that are normally present in dendrites, there were no dramatic increases in the levels of any of the mRNAs either in dentate granule cells or in neurons giving rise to the reinnervating fibers at any postlesion interval. These results indicate that neurons in mature animals can substantially remodel their synaptic terminals and their dendrites in the absence of large-scale changes in gene expression (at least as measured by steady-state mRNA levels at various time points).',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The telencephalon develops from a seemingly homogeneous population of precursor cells that generates neurons with divergent properties and cell fates. An important question concerns the genetic control of cell states belonging to different generations. Mph2 was identified by serial analysis of gene expression as a differentially expressed gene during cortical development. Belonging to the Polycomb group, Mph2 may be involved in transcriptional repression of cell states from one generation to the next. Here, we use in situ hybridization to determine the spatial localization of Mph2 expression in the developing nervous system. Mph2 expression evident in proliferating precursor cell populations in the developing mouse brain such as the ventricular zones of the cortex and ganglionic eminences as well as in mature structures such as the granule cell layer of the adult dentate gyrus and cerebellum indicates a role for Mph2 in both the developing and adult brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Recent studies have demonstrated that the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are induced in hippocampal neurons following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of memory, and that BDNF and NT-3 (but not NGF) can induce LTP-like increases in synaptic efficacy. Receptors for these neurotrophins have been cloned and characterized and we investigated whether LTP alters the expression of two neurotrophin receptors, trkB (BDNF receptor) and trkC (NT-3 receptor) in dentate granule neurons of the hippocampus using in situ hybridization analysis. Results show that trkB is strongly induced in these neurons in an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent manner. Moreover, the induction of trkB and trkC mRNAs was attenuated by sodium pentobarbital, which interferes with the durability of LTP. Low-frequency stimulation of the perforant path had no effect on trkB mRNA levels but significantly reduced trkC mRNA in dentate granule cells. Thus, both BDNF and its receptor trkB are induced in granule cells by stimulation that produces durable LTP, suggesting that this neurotrophin and its receptor play an important role in memory formation and may be suitable targets for the development of cognitive-enhancing drugs in the treatment of diseases, such as Alzheimer's.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) is expressed at high levels by progenitor cells of the ventricular zone (VZ) within the hippocampal primordium. To investigate the role of Fgfr1 in these cells, in vivo Cre recombination of \"floxed\" Fgfr1 alleles was directed to cells of the radial glial lineage by using the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter. Radial glial-like cells of the hippocampal VZ are the progenitors of pyramidal neurons and granule cells of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Mice carrying null Fgfr1 alleles (Fgfr1(Deltaflox)) in cells of this lineage showed a dramatic loss of Fgfr1 gene expression throughout the embryonic dorsal telencephalon. These Fgfr1(Deltaflox) mice exhibited a approximately 30% decrease in dividing radial glial progenitor cells in the hippocampal VZ and DG in the late embryonic period, progressing to a approximately 50-60% loss at birth, without any changes in cell survival. In addition, no FGF2-sensitive neural stem cells could be isolated from the Fgfr1(Deltaflox) hippocampal neuroepithelium, whereas epidermal growth factor-sensitive neural stem cells were not affected. The number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and DG granule cells was approximately 30-50% decreased from the perinatal period through adulthood, and the number of parvalbumin-containing interneurons was similarly decreased in both the DG and pyramidal cell fields. We conclude that Fgfr1 is necessary for hippocampal growth, because it promotes the proliferation of hippocampal progenitors and stem cells during development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurotrophins may have a neuroprotective role and are probably involved in the control of axonal sprouting and synaptic plasticity. An antibody raised against a pro-sequence of nerve growth factor (NGF) was tested. In control undisturbed rats, a strong immunoreactivity was detected in scattered cells in and around the pyramidal and granule cell layer of the hippocampus and a moderate labeling was found in the reticular thalamic nucleus. In situ hybridization showed specific expression of NGF mRNA in a similar population of scattered cells in the hippocampal formation but not in the reticular thalamic nucleus. Acute epileptic seizures, induced by a convulsive dose of 50 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), strongly increased NGF mRNA in neurons of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus 3 hr but not 6 hr after the injection. No change in pro-NGF-like immunoreactivity was observed in the hippocampus or reticular thalamic nucleus after acute seizures. Chemical kindling was induced by daily injections of subconvulsive doses (30 mg/kg) of PTZ for 4 weeks. This treatment significantly increased pro-NGF-like immunoreactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus but did not affect NGF mRNA. These data strengthen a role for the reticular thalamic nucleus and NGF in PTZ kindling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is thought to be involved in several important events during CNS vertebrate development. This study provides additional information concerning the biochemical determination and anatomical localization of NCAM transcripts. Using S1 nuclease protection assays (S1-NPAs), NCAM transcripts in brain appear highest at birth, with NCAM messenger levels reduced some 20-fold by adulthood. By use of in situ hybridization, NCAM mRNA is demonstrated to be developmentally regulated in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The in situ hybridization findings, in addition to providing results to compare with past studies of NCAM immunolocalization, reveal that NCAM expression in dentate gyrus granule cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells is correlated with the final stages of axonal growth, e.g., synaptic stabilization. In situ hybridization demonstrates a developmental outside-to-inside gradient of NCAM transcripts in the dentate gyrus. Neurological mutant mice, reeler and stagger, provide evidence that NCAM expression is normal in the brain regions investigated, and does not correlate with the developmental perturbations present in these strains.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'LRRC4, leucine-rich repeat C4 protein, has been identified in human (GenBank accession No. AF196976), mouse (GenBank accession No. DQ177325), rat (GenBank accession No. DQ119102) and bovine (GenBank accession No. DQ164537) with identical domains. In terms of their similarity, the genes encoding LRRC4 in these four mammalian species are orthogs and therefore correspond to the same gene entity. Based on previous research, and using in situ hybridization, we found that LRRC4 had the strongest expression in hippocampal CA1 and CA2, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus region, the mediodoral thalamic nucleus, and cerebella Purkinje cell layers. Using a P19 cell model, we also found that LRRC4 participates in the differentiation of neuron and glia cells. In addition, extracellular proteins containing both an LRR cassette and immunoglobulin domains have been shown to participate in axon guidance. Our data from neurite outgrowth assays indicated that LRRC4 promoted neurite extension of hippocampal neurons, and induced differentiation of glioblastoma U251 cells into astrocyte-like cells, confirmed by morphology observation and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The \"disinhibition\" hypothesis contends that (1) seizures begin when granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus are disinhibited and (2) disinhibition occurs because GABAergic interneurons are excessively inhibited by other GABAergic interneurons. We tested the disinhibition hypothesis using the experimental model that inspired it-naturally epileptic Mongolian gerbils. To determine whether there is an excess of GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus of epileptic gerbils, as had been reported previously, GABA immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization of GAD67 mRNA, and the optical fractionator method were used. There were no significant differences in the numbers of GABAergic interneurons. To determine whether granule cells in epileptic gerbils were disinhibited during the interictal period, IPSPs were recorded in vivo with hippocampal circuits intact in urethane-anesthetized gerbils. The reversal potentials and conductances of IPSPs in granule cells in epileptic versus control gerbils were similar. To determine whether the level of inhibitory control in the dentate gyrus transiently decreases before seizure onset, field potential responses to paired-pulse perforant path stimulation were obtained from the dorsal hippocampus while epileptic gerbils experienced spontaneous seizures. Evidence of reduced inhibition was found after, but not before, seizure onset, indicating that seizures are not triggered by disinhibition in this region. However, seizure-induced depression of inhibition may amplify and promote the spread of seizure activity to other brain regions. These findings do not support the disinhibition hypothesis and suggest that in this model of epilepsy seizures initiate by another mechanism or at a different site.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Repeated maternal separation of rat pups during the early postnatal period may affect brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurons in brain areas that are compromised by chronic stress. In the present study, a highly significant increase in hippocampal BDNF protein concentration was found in adult rats that as neonates had been subjected to 180 min of daily separation compared with handled rats separated for 15 min daily. BDNF protein was unchanged in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus/paraventricular nucleus. Expression of BDNF mRNA in the CA1, CA3, or dentate gyrus of the hippocampus or in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus was not affected by maternal separation. All animals displayed similar behavioral patterns in a forced-swim paradigm, which did not affect BDNF protein concentration in the hippocampus or hypothalamus. Repeated administration of bromodeoxyuridine revealed equal numbers of surviving, newly generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult rats from the 15 min or 180 min groups. The age-dependent decline in neurogenesis from 3 months to 7 months of age did not differ between the groups. Insofar as BDNF can stimulate neurogenesis and repair, we propose that the elevated hippocampal protein concentration found in maternally deprived rats might be a compensatory reaction to separation during the neonatal period, maintaining adult neurogenesis at levels equal to those of the handled rats.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Sodium channels (NaChs) regulate neuronal excitability in both physiological and pathological conditions, including epilepsy and are therefore an important target for antiepileptic drugs. In the present study, we examined the distribution of mRNAs encoding neonatal NaChs II and III alpha-isoforms in control rat hippocampus and after electrically-induced status epilepticus (SE), using nonradioactive in situ hybridization (ISH). Only weak expression of neonatal NaCh II and III mRNAs was observed in control hippocampus. By contrast, increased expression of neonatal NaCh II and III mRNAs was observed 4 h after the induction of SE in neurons of CA1-CA3 and the dentate granule cell layer. These changes were detected only in rats in which SE was successfully induced and persisted, although less intense, for up to 3 months, when rats display spontaneous seizures. Strong expression of neonatal NaCh alpha-isoforms was observed 1 week after SE in microglial cells, as confirmed by double labelling, combining ISH with immunocytochemistry for microglia markers. The increased expression of neonatal isoforms of the NaCh in both neurons and microglial cells may represent a critical mechanism for modulation of neuronal excitability, glial function and pharmacological response to antiepileptic drugs in the course of epileptogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Changes in extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 areas and the induction of glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 in dentate granule cells of rats treated with kainic acid.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'For the evaluation of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission during seizures, rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas were separately assessed by brain microdialysis, and extracelluar glutamate and GABA were measured through the course of the seizures after a systemic administration of kainic acid (KA). The generalized convulsion started at about 1.5 h and was suppressed by diazepam at 2 h after the KA treatment. In the CA3 area, extracellular glutamate started to increase soon after the KA injection and returned to the control level at about 1.5 h. A decrease and then slight increase of the extracellular glutamate level in CA3 followed the diazepam injection. In the CA1 area, in contrast, a long-lasting decrease of extracellular glutamate was observed. The extracellular GABA concentration in the CA3 area increased immediately after the systemic administration of KA and returned to the normal level at about 3.5 h. A second increase in the extracellular GABA in this area began at about 4.5 h after the KA treatment. In the CA1 area, an increase of extracellular GABA began at about 3.5 h after KA administration (much later than that observed in the CA3 area) and was maintained throughout the observation. In situ hybridization showed a transient expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-67 mRNA in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus at 4 and 6 h, whereas GAD65 mRNA was unaffected. GABA immunoreactivity in the same area and mossy fibers in the CA3 were increased most significantly at 8 h after administration of KA. The possible relation of GABA induction in mossy fibers with the delayed increase in extracellular GABA in CA3 was discussed.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in long-term synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus, but the cellular mechanisms are little understood. Here we used intrahippocampal microinfusion of BDNF to trigger long-term potentiation (BDNF-LTP) at medial perforant path--granule cell synapses in vivo. BDNF infusion led to rapid phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) and p38 but not JNK (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase). These effects were restricted to the infused dentate gyrus; no changes were observed in microdissected CA3 and CA1 regions. Local infusion of MEK (MAP kinase kinase) inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) during BDNF delivery abolished BDNF-LTP and the associated ERK activation. Application of MEK inhibitor during established BDNF-LTP had no effect. Activation of MEK-ERK is therefore required for the induction, but not the maintenance, of BDNF-LTP. BDNF-LTP was further coupled to ERK-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein. Finally, we investigated the expression of two immediate early genes, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and Zif268, both of which are required for generation of late, mRNA synthesis-dependent LTP. BDNF infusion resulted in selective upregulation of mRNA and protein for Arc. In situ hybridization showed that Arc transcripts are rapidly and extensively delivered to granule cell dendrites. U0126 blocked Arc upregulation in parallel with BDNF-LTP. The results support a model in which BDNF triggers long-lasting synaptic strengthening through MEK-ERK and selective induction of the dendritic mRNA species Arc.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'mKirre, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila kirre, is expressed in bone marrow stromal cells and the brain. Although mKirre has been shown to support the hematopoietic stem cells, little is known about the function of mKirre in the brain. In the present study, to gain insights into the function of mKirre, we investigated the expression pattern of mKirre gene in the developing and adult mouse brain using in situ hybridization. In the adult brain, mKirre mRNA was highly expressed in the olfactory bulb, the piriform cortex, the cochlear nucleus, and the cerebellum. At embryonic day (E) 11.5, we could observe mKirre mRNA in the differentiating zones of various regions, such as the caudate-putamen, the geniculate body, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the brainstem. Its gene expression in these regions at E11.5 also persisted to the adult, in which its expression levels were much less prominent. After birth, we could first observe high expression of mKirre mRNA in the glomerular and mitral layers of the olfactory bulb, the cortical plate of the neocortex, the cochlear nucleus, and the molecular and granule cell layers of the cerebellum. In the hippocampus, its gene expression was first observed in the dentate gyrus at postnatal day 7. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of mKirre mRNA suggests important roles of mKirre in later developmental processes, especially the synapse formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kainate-induced seizure activity causes persistent changes in the hippocampus that include synaptic reorganization and functional changes in the mossy fibers. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, the expression of PKC alpha, PKC beta, PKC gamma, PKC delta and PKC epsilon mRNAs was investigated in the hippocampus of adult rats following seizures induced by a s.c. injection of kainic acid. In CA1 and CA3, we found a significant decrease in PKC gamma mRNA 1 day after kainic acid which persisted for a 2nd day in CA1. None of the other PKC isoform mRNAs were altered in CA1 or CA3. In granule cells, a significant up-regulation specific to PKC epsilon mRNA was observed. One week after kainic acid administration, a marked increase in PKC epsilon immunoreactivity was found that persisted 2 months after kainic acid administration. PKC epsilon immunoreactivity was found associated with mossy fibers projecting to the hilus of the dentate gyrus and to the stratum lucidum of the CA3 field and presumably with the newly sprouted mossy fibers projecting to the supragranular layer. These data provide the first evidence for a long-lasting increase of the PKC epsilon in the axons of granule cells caused by kainate-induced seizures and suggest that PKC epsilon may be involved in the functional and/or structural modifications of granule cells that occur after limbic seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'It has been supposed that central nervous neurons do not express MHC class I molecules. However, recent studies clearly demonstrated functional MHC class I expression in the rodent brain. In the present study, we have extended these studies and investigated the presence of MHC class I transcripts and proteins in the brain of a non-human primate species, the common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus). Using in-situ hybridization, we found strong expression of MHC class I transcripts in neocortex, hippocampal formation, substantia nigra and nucleus ruber. In-situ hybridization with emulsion autoradiography demonstrated MHC class I mRNA in distinct pyramidal neurons of cortex and hippocampus, in granule neurons of the dentate gyrus, in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra and in motor neurons of nucleus ruber. Immunocytochemistry confirmed MHC class I protein expression in these neurons. Two monoclonal antibodies, MRC-Ox18 and HB115, reacted differentially with MHC class I proteins on neuronal and non-neuronal cells, respectively. Interestingly, in marmoset monkeys that were immunosuppressed with FK506 (tacrolimus), expression of neuronal MHC class I proteins, which could be detected with MRC-Ox18, was either very low (neocortex, nucleus ruber, substantia nigra) or absent (hippocampus). In contrast, class I expression in endothelial cells, which was detected by HB115, was not affected by immunosuppression. Our data show that selected neurons in the brain of a non-human primate express MHC class I molecules and that this expression can be modulated by immunosuppression.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of the axonal membrane glycoprotein M6a is regulated by chronic stress.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'It has been repeatedly shown that chronic stress changes dendrites, spines and modulates expression of synaptic molecules. These effects all may impair information transfer between neurons. The present study shows that chronic stress also regulates expression of M6a, a glycoprotein which is localised in axonal membranes. We have previously demonstrated that M6a is a component of glutamatergic axons. The present data reveal that it is the splice variant M6a-Ib, not M6a-Ia, which is strongly expressed in the brain. Chronic stress in male rats (3 weeks daily restraint) has regional effects: quantitative in situ hybridization demonstrated that M6a-Ib mRNA in dentate gyrus granule neurons and in CA3 pyramidal neurons is downregulated, whereas M6a-Ib mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex is upregulated by chronic stress. This is the first study showing that expression of an axonal membrane molecule is differentially affected by stress in a region-dependent manner. Therefore, one may speculate that diminished expression of the glycoprotein in the hippocampus leads to altered output in the corresponding cortical projection areas. Enhanced M6a-Ib expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (in areas prelimbic and infralimbic cortex) might be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism in response to changes in axonal projections from the hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence that in addition to alterations in dendrites and spines chronic stress also changes the integrity of axons and may thus impair information transfer even between distant brain regions.',\n",

Although ARFRP1 is involved in post-Golgi membrane trafficking and its lack leads to embryonic lethality, little is known about its possible function in the central nervous system. To obtain more knowledge about ARFRP1, we have characterized its mRNA distribution in adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR. We observed a widespread distribution of ARFRP1-mRNA, with the highest levels in cerebral cortex, thalamic nuclei, colliculus, substantia nigra and granule cell layer of cerebellum. Moderate levels were observed in some amygdaloid nuclei, CA2 area and dentate gyrus of hippocampus, endopiriform nuclei, globus pallidus, striatum, molecular layer of cerebellum, and locus coeruleus, whereas no expression was detected in hypothalamic nuclei, CA1 and CA3 areas of hippocampus, zona incerta. A significant decrease of ARFRP1-mRNA was observed in cerebral cortex following sleep deprivation, whereas no change was observed in cerebellar cortex, locus courelus, brainstem, hippocampus and pontine nuclei.

       "  'Abstract': \"We employed in situ hybridization and quantitative densitometry techniques to examine hippocampal mRNA expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha1 and alpha5 in human subjects with progressing cognitive impairment. Included in this study were 17 participants of the Religious Order Study (ROS), who were categorized into three groups based upon degree of cognitive impairment: no cognitive impairment (n = 6); moderate cognitive impairment (n = 5); and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 6). While the levels of each specific subunit mRNA were relatively homogeneously distributed throughout the five hippocampal subregions analyzed (CA1-4, and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus), mRNA expression of the alpha1 receptor subunit was found to be 20% reduced in the moderate cognitive impairment group as compared to the no cognitive impairment group. In addition, alpha1 mRNA expression was 25% reduced in the probable Alzheimer's disease group compared to the group with no cognitive impairment. Similarly, alpha5 subunit mRNA was reduced 32% between no cognitive impairment and moderate cognitive impairment groups, and 35% between no cognitive impairment and probable Alzheimer's disease groups. No significant reductions were found between moderate cognitive impairment and probable Alzheimer's disease groups for either subunit. Collectively, our data provide evidence for modest reductions in GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs, and suggest these changes occur very early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease cognitive impairment.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Animals exposed to kainic acid (KA) induced status epilepticus display a striking pattern of selective neuronal vulnerability in the hippocampus. Neurons in the hilus/CA3 and CA1 subfields appear particularly sensitive whereas dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells are resistant. The molecular basis for this differential susceptibility remains largely unknown. Recently, an involvement of nitric oxide, c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) and interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE)-related proteases has been proposed in KA induced neuronal cell death. In the present study, we have determined the regional expression of transcripts for two modulating genes operating in these pathways, i.e., the endogenous protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (PIN), and a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway, designated JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and of the gene for the apoptosis-executing protease Caspase-3 in KA-treated animals. The expression of PIN and JIP-1 was found significantly upregulated in granule cells of the resistant DG. In contrast, an induction of the ICE-related protease Caspase-3 was observed in vulnerable hippocampal regions, i.e. CA1, CA3 and hilus. These results point towards PIN and JIP-1 as antiapoptotic factors contributing to selective resistance of granule cells, whereas Caspase-3 may be involved in cell death of hippocampal CA1, CA3 and hilar neurons in the kainate epilepsy model.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Increased vulnerability to kainate-induced seizures in utrophin-knockout mice.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Utrophin, the autosomal homologue of dystrophin, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene product, is a cytoskeletal protein found in many tissues. In muscle fibers, the level and localization of utrophin depend on their state of differentiation and innervation. Transgenic overexpression of utrophin prevents degeneration of dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers. In brain, in addition to its enrichment in blood vessels, utrophin is associated primarily with the plasma membrane of large sensory and motor brainstem neurons, suggesting a contribution to their structural stability. Here, we examined the role of utrophin for long-term survival of dentate granule cells, which become markedly hypertrophic in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This morphogenetic change is induced several weeks after a unilateral intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA), while mice experience chronic focal seizures. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we show that dispersion and hypertrophy of granule cells in KA-treated wildtype mice are accompanied by a strong and long-lasting expression of utrophin in somata and proximal dendrites. Utrophin knockout mice had a normal hippocampal cytoarchitecture but were more sensitive to KA-induced excitotoxicity, as shown by increased mortality and faster progression of the lesion. At 6 weeks post-KA, the numerical density of granule cells and thickness of the granule cell layer were significantly reduced ipsilaterally in mutant mice, indicating a profound reduction in total cell number in the absence of utrophin. These findings suggest that utrophin contributes to protect CNS neurons against pathological insults, in particular, stimuli leading to massive neuronal hypertrophy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We report NMDA receptor-dependent expression of synaptopodin mRNA in the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in vivo. Synaptopodin did not belong to immediate-early genes, as de novo protein synthesis was required for the induction of synaptopodin gene transcription. An increased level of synaptopodin mRNA was observed at 75 min and 3.5 h after the onset of LTP. Importantly, there was correlation between the induction of mRNA expression and the persistence of LTP. Synaptopodin immunoreactivity was elevated specifically in synaptic layers, middle and outer molecular layers of dentate gyrus where LTP was induced. As synaptopodin is an actin-associated protein present in spine neck and implicated in the modulation of cell morphology, our results suggest that synaptopodin, by regulating the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, contributes to the morphological change in spine shape considered to be important for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The aim of the present study was to assess the age-dependent response of microtubule-associated protein 1B, a plasticity-associated protein deriving from a late gene, following administration of an epileptogenic stimulus. The effect of a single administration of the convulsant pentylenetetrazole on microtubule-associated protein 1B expression in the hippocampal formation and cortex of three-, 18- and 28-month-old rats was assessed using northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In three-month-old rats, we detected initial increases in microtubule-associated protein 1B messenger RNA at 15 h following pentylenetetrazole administration in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and in layers II/III of the entorhinal cortex, and these reached a maximum at 44 h. However, in the hippocampus and cortex of 18-month-old rats, the peak occurred at 15 h, and in the brains of 28-month-old rats a blunted peak was reached at 3 h. Pentylenetetrazole treatment in young rats resulted in a robust induction of microtubule-associated protein 1B immunoreactivity in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in layers II/III of the entorhinal cortex, but also produced a large decrease in the retrosplenial cortex. However, following pentylenetetrazole treatment in older rats, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus were nearly devoid of microtubule-associated protein 1B immunoreactivity, whereas the retrosplenial cortex showed no changes at all, and the entorhinal cortex had an expression pattern similar to that of young rats. Aberrant immunolabeling of microtubule-associated protein 1B occurred in cortical layer VI of the aged rats where, unlike in young rats, there was heavy staining of neuronal somata. These results suggest that the regulation of the plasticity-associated protein microtubule-associated protein 1B is altered in the ageing rat brain, with the peak of expression shifted to earlier times in 18-month-old rats and blunted, variable increases at even earlier times in 28-month-old rats.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'After 3 or 4 weeks of age, insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene expression in normal rats has been detected only in mesenchymal tissue associated with the central nervous system. In contrast, the IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor has been reported to be widely distributed in adult rat brain. This study was performed in order to clarify the cellular localization of IGF-II and IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor in rat brain by comparing an immunocytochemical map with the distribution of mRNAs by in situ hybridization. The highest levels of IGF-II mRNA were detected in the choroid plexus and meningeal membranes. In contrast, IGF-II receptor transcripts were mainly present in neuron-rich areas such as the hippocampus, with a lower signal present in the choroid plexus and meninges. Specific IGF-II receptor immunoreactivity was present in neurons throughout the forebrain, with the highest intensity in the pyramidal cell and polymorphic layers of the hippocampus and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. This distribution was similar to that obtained with the in situ hybridization technique. No glial staining was detected. Although the role of IGF-II in the adult rat brain, acting through its specific receptor, is not clear; in vitro and in vivo data suggest a possible neurotropic and/or neuromodulatory action.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'By fluorescent differential display, we identified six transcripts (CAPS2/Cadps2, Cdh22, b1402, c1502, d1401, and d1501) that showed the differential expression patterns during the postnatal development of the mouse cerebellum. We further analyzed the latter four transcripts whose cellular localizations in developing mouse brains have not been studied. In the postnatal cerebellum, clones c1502 and d1501 were transiently up-regulated; clone b1402 was up-regulated; and clone d1401 remained relatively constant. Sequence analysis revealed that d1401 and c1502 were derivatives of Ogdh (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) and QP-C (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex ubiquinone-binding protein), respectively. Moreover, b1402 and d1501 were identified as transcripts of a predicted gene (4933409K07Rik) and a novel EST, respectively. b1402 and d1501 were abundantly present in the cerebellum, whereas c1502/QP-C and d1401/Ogdh were widely distributed in various mouse tissues. In the postnatal mouse brain, moderately high mRNA levels of b1402 were restricted to the olfactory bulb, striatum, cerebral cortex (layers II-III and VI), hippocampus (dentate granule cells), and cerebellum (granule cells). c1502/QP-C mRNA was localized at high levels in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus (anterodorsal nucleus, parafacicularis nucleus), tegmentum (red nucleus), cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells), and pons (pontine nucleus, reticulotegmental nucleus, trapezoid body, vestibular nucleus).

We cloned a rat YARP cDNA that encoded a 2256 amino acid protein with 93% homology to the human counterpart. Northern blots revealed significant expression of the YARP gene in the rat brain. In situ hybridization demonstrated its expression in neurons throughout the brain, including pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and granule cells in the dentate gyrus. YARP was coexpressed with YY1 in these same neuronal cells. However, there was no evidence of YARP expression in glia. In the developing rat brain, the level of YARP mRNA ( approximately 10 kb) peaked at embryonic day 18 and promptly declined thereafter to reach the steady-state level found in adulthood, by 14 days after birth. These results suggest that YARP functions at a late stage of neurogenesis during perinatal development of the rat brain, as well as in mature neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Systemic kainic acid administration in rats induces acute limbic status epilepticus and subsequent neuronal degeneration and development of chronic hyperexcitability with similarities to human temporal lobe epilepsy. The mechanisms mediating the responses to kainic acid likely involve transcriptional changes in genes of importance for cellular injury, protection, and plasticity. We have used an arbitrarily primed PCR technique to identify such changes in the rat dentate gyrus. Three previously uncharacterized transcripts were found to be upregulated in the dentate gyrus 4 h following systemic kainic acid. In situ hybridization using riboprobes transcribed from the cloned PCR fragments were used to confirm differential expression specifically in dentate granule neurons following seizure. Basal expression for all three transcripts is widespread throughout the rat brain, with the highest levels seen in the hippocampal pyramidal and granule cell layers. The novel sequences do not match any known full-length cDNAs and may belong to novel gene families. However, they all showed high homology to human partial cDNA sequences (ESTs) that are expressed in brain as well as several other tissues. Two additional transcripts identified in this study corroborate earlier findings on differential expression of heat-shock proteins after seizure. The novel transcripts found in this study may be involved in epileptogenesis and neuronal responses to damage following seizure.',\n",

In vitro binding of [3H]CP-55,940, a synthetic cannabinoid, was examined by autoradiography in fresh frozen brain sections from normal aged humans (n = 3), patients who died with Alzheimer's disease (n = 5) and patients who died with other forms of cortical pathology (n = 5). In the structures examined--hippocampal formation, neocortex, basal ganglia and parts of the brainstem--receptor binding showed a characteristic pattern of high densities in the dentate gyrus molecular layer, globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, moderate densities in the hippocampus, neocortex, amygdala and striatum, and low densities in the white matter and brainstem. In situ hybridization histochemistry of human cannabinoid receptor, a ribonucleotide probe for the human cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA, showed a pattern of extremely dense transcript levels in subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and cortex, moderate levels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and neurons of the striatum, amygdala and hypothalamus, and no signal over dentate gyrus granule cells and most of the cells of the thalamus and upper brainstem, including the substantia nigra. In Alzheimer's brains, compared to normal brains, [3H]CP-55,940 binding was reduced by 37-45% in all of the subfields of the hippocampal formation and by 49% in the caudate. Lesser reductions (20-24%) occurred in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, internal segment. Other neocortical and basal ganglia structures were not different from control levels. Levels of messenger RNA expression did not differ between Alzheimer's and control brains, but there were regionally discrete statistically significant losses of the intensely expressing cells in the hippocampus. The reductions in binding did not correlate with or localize to areas showing histopathology, estimated either on the basis of overall tissue quality or silver staining of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Reduced [3H]55,940 binding was associated with increasing age and with other forms of cortical pathology, suggesting that receptor losses are related to the generalized aging and/or disease process and are not selectively associated with the pathology characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, nor with overall decrements in levels of cannabinoid receptor gene expression.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A group of four proteins with recognition sites for L-glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, glycine, and competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors was previously purified from rat brain synaptic membranes. The biochemical and immunochemical characteristics of this complex, as well as the sequences of the complementary DNAs of three subunits, are distinct from those of other glutamate receptors, transporters, or enzymes. The function of this complex has not yet been defined, but it appears to be involved in glutamate-induced neuronal excitation and toxicity. It is not known whether all protein components of the complex are expressed in the same populations of brain cells. In the present study, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization were used to map the distribution of the glutamate-binding, glycine/thienylcyclohexylpiperidine-binding, and carboxypiperazinyl-propylphosphonate-binding protein subunits of the complex. These proteins were abundantly expressed in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, cerebellum, and olfactory tubercle. Based on these results, it was concluded that the three subunits of the complex have similar patterns of expression in rat brain. The distribution of one subunit of the complex, glutamate-binding protein, was traced throughout the rat brain, thus providing a potential map of the expression of the complex in rodent brain. In addition, probes were developed in the present study that should be useful in future explorations of the role of these proteins in brain function and of the possible co-localization of the protein subunits in single cells or cell processes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The messenger RNAs encoding three somatostatin receptor subtypes, SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3, were detected in rat by RNA blotting and in situ hybridization histochemistry to identify the sites of synthesis and expression of these somatostatin receptor subtypes. RNA blotting revealed that SSTR1 messenger RNA of 3.8 kilobases was highly expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and hypothalamus. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that SSTR1 messenger RNA was localized to discrete layers of the cerebral cortex, the piriform cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. SSTR1 messenger RNA was expressed at low levels in the cerebellum and pituitary and was not detectable in striatum or other peripheral organs. At least two SSTR2 messenger RNAs were detected by RNA blotting of 2.4 and 2.8 kilobases which correspond to the size of the spliced and unspliced forms of this receptor messenger RNA. SSTR2 messenger RNA detected by in situ hybridization is diffusely expressed in cerebral cortex and amygdala but is discretely localized to dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, medial habenula and ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. The levels of SSTR2 messenger RNA are very low in the cerebellum and were not observed in the striatum or peripheral tissues other than the pituitary or adrenal gland. A single SSTR3 messenger RNA of 4.0 kilobases was seen in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, midbrain, hypothalamus and pituitary. However, the tissue with the highest levels of SSTR3 messenger RNA is the cerebellum with messenger RNA localized to the granule cell layer. The expression of the three different somatostatin receptor messenger RNAs are distinct but overlapping. Such distinct expression may contribute to the selective biological roles of the receptor subtypes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Tau protein variants are axonal microtubule-associated phosphoproteins whose expression correlates with developmentally regulated neurite outgrowth. A single gene encodes multiple tau transcripts via complex alternative splicing. We studied the expression of the mRNAs encoding N-terminal variants of tau, and we showed distinct alternative splicing of exons 2 and 3 in nervous tissues of the adult rat, including the inner ear, hippocampus, cortex, striatum, brainstem, cerebellum, olfactory bulb and retina. Using the reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, we then focused our developmental study on hippocampal neurons, both in vivo and in vitro, to address the developmental and spatial expression of the alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding N-terminal variants of tau. Tau mRNAs devoid of exons 2 and 3 were present throughout development, although their levels decreased in adults. Those containing exon 2 but not exon 3 were already present in the hippocampus of newborn rats and their levels increased during the first postnatal week, mainly in the pyramidal cell layer. Tau RNAs containing exons 2 and 3 appeared at the end of this period in the pyramidal cell layer and in the dentate granule cells. Exon 2-containing mRNAs seemed to be associated with cells undergoing axonal sprouting, while exon 3-containing RNAs were expressed in mature neurons that had established their connections. The timing and pattern of tau alternative splicing were maintained in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that splicing processes are independent of the organized connectivity and of the environmental cues provided in vivo. Secondary structure predictions of tau variants revealed that the insertion of the exon 3-encoded domain substantially modifies the secondary structure of the N-terminal region of tau. This N-terminal heterogeneity may confer distinct regulatory roles on the tau variants during ontogeny and may contribute to plasticity in the adult rat brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Polysialyltransferase (PST) is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of polysialic acid (PSA), a homopolymer of alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid residues, onto neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). The expression of PSA-NCAM in the brain is developmentally regulated and is of critical importance; however, the temporal and spatial developmental expression of brain PST, a potential key player in the control of PSA-NCAM levels, remains unclear. In the present study, we have cloned the coding region of rat PST cDNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using primers based on the hamster PST-1 cDNA sequence. A 39-mer oligonucleotide complementary to rat PST cDNA was synthesized to investigate the distribution of its mRNA in the developing and adult rat brain by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. In the embryonic rat brain, PST mRNA was detected abundantly throughout the neuroepithelia of most brain regions. At post-natal days 1 and 14, PST was detected throughout the neocortex, in the pyramidal cells (PC) of the hippocampus proper, the granule cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus, the anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus (AVNT) and the GCL and external germinal layer of the cerebellum. Finally, from PD21 until adulthood, expression of PST mRNA was restricted to the PC layer of the hippocampus proper, the GCL of the dentate gyrus, the AVNT, the GCL of the cerebellum and the dorsal and lateral nucleus of the anterior olfactory bulb. The developmental profile of PST mRNA is paralleled in some structures by that of the PSA-NCAM, there are, however, notable exceptions. Therefore, our results demonstrate that expression of rat PST mRNA is developmentally regulated, is present in the adult rat brain in restricted areas and may be involved in regulating temporal and spatial expression of PSA-NCAM.',\n",

In cortex, the highest levels of glutamate receptor subunit mRNAs were found in layer I and layers III-IV of entorhinal and temporal cortex, although significant levels were also observed in the other cell layers. A differential distribution was seen in cerebellum where the A-subunit mRNA is expressed mainly by Purkinje cells, while the B-subunit mRNA is present in the internal granule cell layer. These results correlate well with previous data from autoradiographic studies on the localization of excitatory amino acid binding sites in human brain and pinpoint the cells where these receptors are synthesized. In situ hybridization in the hippocampus of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (age range 77-82 years, postmortem delay 19-25.5 h) revealed a decrease on the content of the mRNAs coding for these excitatory amino acid receptors, while an increase was detected in surgically dissected epileptic human hippocampi. These results corroborate and extend the previous data from in vitro autoradiography and suggest alteration of the excitatory amino acid disfunction during these neurodegenerative processes.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We investigated the expression of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C after induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by high-frequency tetanization (HFT) in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo. Expression of tenascin-C was evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Whereas no tenascin-C mRNA was detectable in control animals, an increase in tenascin-C mRNA levels was observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus 4 h after HFT. At 24 h after HFT, tenascin-C mRNA had returned to control levels. Expression of tenascin-C protein 4 h after HFT followed that of controls in that tenascin was detectable in the strata oriens and radiatum of CA1, in the molecular layer, and within a narrow area at the inner surface of the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus. However, 24 h after HFT, additional patches of tenascin-C immunoreactivity were observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. No increase in tenascin mRNA or protein levels was detected in control animals that received no stimulation, low-frequency stimulation, or HFT in the presence of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid or the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. These observations implicate a role for tenascin-C in N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent changes accompanying induction and/or maintenance of LTP.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Alterations in the opioid system in the hippocampal formation and some of the possible functional consequences were investigated in adult male rats that were prenatally exposed to either saline or morphine (10 mg/kg twice daily on gestational days 11-18). In situ hybridization and Northern blots were used to measure proenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA, and radioimmunoassays quantified proenkephalin- and prodynorphin-derived peptide levels in the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1 subfields of the hippocampal formation. Prenatal morphine exposure in male rats decreases proenkephalin and increases prodynorphin mRNA selectively in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Similarly, met-enkephalin peptide levels are decreased and dynorphin B peptide levels are increased in the dentate gyrus but not CA3 or CA1 of prenatally morphine-exposed males. In addition, there are decreases in dynorphin-derived peptides in the CA3 subfield. Receptor autoradiography revealed increases in the density of micro but not delta receptor labeling in discrete strata of specific hippocampal subfields in morphine-exposed males. Because alterations in the hippocampal opioid system suggest possible alterations in the excitability of the hippocampal formation, changes in opioid regulation of seizures were examined. Morphine exposure, however, does not alter the latency to onset or number of episodes of wet dog shakes or clonic seizures induced by infusion of 10 nmol [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5]enkephalin into the ventral hippocampal formation. Interestingly, a naloxone (5 mg/kg) injection 30 min before bicuculline administration reverses the increased latency to onset of clonic and tonic-clonic seizures in morphine-exposed males. Thus, the present study suggests that exposure of rats to morphine during early development alters the hippocampal opioid system, suggesting possible consequences for hippocampal-mediated functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We studied brain synapsin I and II mRNA levels using the amygdala kindling model of epilepsy. There were significant increases in the synapsin I mRNA level in the granule cell layer of the hippocampal bilateral dentate gyrus. One to 8 h after seizures, the level in the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to stimulation increased by 44.2-73.2%, compared with the control level. Of the time points investigated, the greatest increase in expression was observed 8 h after the kindled seizures. Furthermore, the synapsin I mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus contralateral to stimulation increased by 28.0% and 51.1%, 2 and 8 h, respectively, after the kindled seizures. Expression of this mRNA, however, did not change significantly in other areas examined, including CA1, CA2, CA3 and the polymorphic layer of the hippocampus and the perirhinal and temporal cortices. Synapsin II mRNA levels did not change significantly in any of the regions studied for up to 24 h after the seizures and synapsin II was presumed to have little involvement in kindling. We considered the locally elevated synapsin I mRNA levels in the bilateral dentate gyrus associated with kindling indicate that excitatory changes occur in the synaptic circuit in which the dentate granule cells participate. Synapsin I may be involved in the presynaptic molecular mechanisms underlying the neuronal plasticity in kindling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"We studied the expression and distribution of Na/HCO(3) cotransporters in rat brain using polynucleotide probes and polyclonal antibodies derived from the electrogenic rat kidney Na/HCO(3) cotransporter (rkNBC). In whole brain, we observed a single mRNA ( approximately 7.5 kb) by Northern hybridization and a major approximately 130 kDa protein by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antiserum directed against the C terminus of rkNBC. NBC mRNA and protein were present in cortex, brainstem-diencephalon, and cerebellum. In situ hybridization revealed NBC mRNA expression throughout the CNS, with particularly high levels in olfactory bulb, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and cerebellum. NBC mRNA was present in glial cells (e.g., Bergmann glia of cerebellum and hippocampal astrocytes) and neurons (e.g., granule cells of dentate gyrus and neurons of cortex or striatum). Double hybridization of mRNA encoding NBC and glutamate transporter 1 (glial marker) confirmed that both glia and neurons express NBC. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated NBC protein throughout the CNS, particularly in hippocampus and cerebellum. Although NBC mRNA was restricted to cell bodies, NBC protein was distributed diffusely, compatible with a localization in cell processes and perhaps cell bodies. Double labeling with glial fibrillary acidic protein (astrocytic marker), microtubule-associated protein 2 (neuronal marker), or 2',3'-cyclic mononucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (oligodendrocytic marker) demonstrated expression of NBC protein in specific subpopulations of both glia and neurons. Moreover, NBC protein was present in both cultured hippocampal astrocytes and cortical neurons. NBC mRNA and protein were also present in epithelial cells of choroid plexus, ependyma, and meninges. Our results are thus consistent with multiple novel roles for Na/HCO(3) cotransport in CNS physiology.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In order to reveal axonal rewiring in the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions after status epilepticus, we investigated the temporal evolution of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) mRNA and protein expression in two rat models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Status epilepticus (SE) was induced by electrical stimulation of the angular bundle or by intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injections. Despite increased GAP-43 mRNA expression in dentate granule cells at 24 h after SE, GAP-43 protein expression in the inner molecular layer (IML) of the dentate gyrus decreased progressively after 24 h after SE in both models. Nevertheless robust mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) was evident in the IML of chronic epileptic rats. Remaining GAP-43 protein expression in the IML in chronic epileptic rats did not correlate with the extent of MFS, but with the number of surviving hilar neurons. In the parahippocampal region, GAP-43 mRNA expression was decreased in layer III of the medial entorhinal area (MEAIII) in parallel with extensive neuronal loss in this layer. There was a tendency of GAP-43 mRNA up-regulation in the presubiculum, a region that projects to MEAIII. With regard to this parahippocampal region, however, changes in GAP-43 mRNA expression were not followed by protein changes. The presence of the presynaptic protein GAP-43 in a neurodegenerated MEAIII indicates that fibers still project to this layer. Whether reorganization of fibers has occurred in this region after SE needs to be investigated with tools other than GAP-43.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) play important roles in vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal regulation and its activation depends on guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs). By way of in situ hybridization histochemistry, the localization of mRNAs for subfamily members of low-molecular-weight ARF-GEPs in the rat brain was studied at embryonic and postnatal stages. In the embryonic brain, the gene expression for msec7-1 was distinct in the ventricular zone while that for msec7-1, -3 and EFA6 in the mantle zone. In early postnatal brain, the expression for msec7-1, -2, -3 and EFA6 was seen widely in various loci of the gray matter with different intensity, and the expression of msec7-1 and -2 mRNAs was evident in the cerebellar external granule cell layer. In the adult brain, the gene expression for the four ARF-GEPs decreased more or less in most gray matter and the distinct expression was maintained mainly in the hippocampal and dentate neuronal layers and cerebellar cortex. The expression of EFA6 mRNA was also evident in the molecular layer of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. No obvious gene expression for cytohesin-4 and ARF-GEP100 was detected in the brain at any stages of development. The present findings suggest that ARF-GEPs are differentially involved in some processes essential to neuronal differentiation and maturation in association with ARFs.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Dystrophin and dystroglycan messenger RNAs are expressed in specific brain areas, including regions of the cortex and the hippocampus, and in such neurons dystrophin has been localized to postsynaptic densities. In the present study we examined by in situ hybridization the effect of neuronal activation and neurotoxicity induced by kainate and pentylenetetrazole administered in vivo on dystrophin and dystroglycan expression in the rat brain. Kainate injection resulted in a transient but dramatic decrease in dystrophin transcript levels in the dentate gyrus granule cells, neurons not affected by kainate neurotoxicity, 6 h after injection. There was also a strong, concomitant increase in dystrophin messenger RNA levels in the CA3 subfield. At 24-72 h after kainate injection, the dystrophin transcript in the dentate granule cells returned to control levels, while it decreased gradually in the CA subfields, coinciding with the neurodegeneration observed in these areas. Comparable results were obtained with pan-dystrophin probes and probes specific to the short, G-dystrophin (Dp71) isoform that predominates in the dentate gyrus. This indicates that any dystrophin transcript that might be expressed in these areas responds to kainate in the same manner. In contrast, kainate insult had no significant effect on the dystroglycan messenger RNA levels in these hippocampal areas at 6 h post-injection. At later times. however, there was a gradual decrease in the dystroglycan messenger RNA in those areas which respond to the kainate insult with extensive neuronal death. For comparison, seizures which are not associated with progressive neurodegeneration were induced by pentylenetetrazole: in this situation the dystrophin and dystroglycan messenger RNA levels remained unchanged in all areas of the hippocampal formation. Since activation of glutamate receptors is thought to be involved in some forms of synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus, our data indicate that the dystrophin gene behaves as a candidate plasticity-related gene responding to glutamate.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using a cDNA probe complementary to an mRNA coding for the alpha-subunit of a human GTP-binding protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase we have studied its regional distribution in human brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The specificity of the hybridization signal was examined by using a labelled sense probe and RNase treatment. Gs alpha transcripts presented a widespread but heterogeneous distribution in human brain postmortem tissues. The cell bodies of the granular layer of the cerebellum were the most heavily labelled cells in all the cases examined. High levels of hybridization were also seen in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and over the cell bodies of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Several cortical regions also presented high levels of hybridization. Another area rich in the Gs alpha mRNA was the hypothalamus. The caudate and putamen nuclei presented intermediate levels while the globus pallidus, the thalamus, the midbrain and the brainstem presented only very low levels of hybridization. This distribution differs from the known distribution of adenylate cyclase activity and other GTP-binding proteins, and could indicate that this particular Gs alpha clone codes for a subset of the alpha-subunit of the Gs protein family.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"mRNAs for isozymes of phospholipase C (PLC) were localized in rat brain by in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes for PLC isozymes I, II, and III of Rhee's group [Suh, P.-G., Ryu, S. H., Moon, K. H., Suh, H. W. & Rhee, S. G. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5419-5423 and (1988) Cell 54, 161-169], and isozyme I of Bennett and Crooke [Bennett, C. F., Balcarek, J. M., Varrichio, A. & Crooke, S. T. (1988) Nature (London) 334, 268-270], which we designate PLC-A. The isozymes displayed different localizations. PLC-A mRNA was highest in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, choroid plexus, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei, rostral raphe nuclei, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. PLC-I was highest in the internal granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, reticular nucleus of thalamus, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and granule cell layer of the cerebellum. PLC-II had a more widespread distribution, with relatively high levels in the internal granular layer of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells. PLC-III label was low throughout the brain. These distributions suggest selective coupling of individual PLC isozymes with particular postsynaptic receptors. PLC-A may be preferentially associated with 5-hydroxytryptamine 1C receptors, vasopressin V1 receptors, and a subtype of glutamate receptors. PLC-I may be linked to muscarinic m1 and m3 receptors as well as other receptors. The distribution of PLC-II mRNA resembles that of src protooncogene, with which it displays sequence homology.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ciliary neurotrophic factor is a pleiotropic molecule thought to have multiple functions in the developing and adult nervous system. To investigate the role of ciliary neurotrophic factor in the developing and mature brain by defining putative target cells the expression of the ligand-binding alpha-subunit of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor was studied in neonatal and adult rat brains using a digoxygenin-labelled probe for in situ hybridization. Neuronal populations expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha messenger RNA were found in many functionally diverse brain areas including the olfactory bulb (mitral cells and other neurons) neocortex (layer V) and other cortical areas (pyramidal cell layers in the piriform cortex and hippocampus, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus) and distinct nuclei in the thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem. In the latter, reticular nuclei and both cranial motor and sensory nerve nuclei showed intense hybridization signals in the neonatal brain. The nucleus ruber, substantia nigra pars reticularis, deep cerebellar nuclei and a subpopulation of cells in the internal granular layer of the cerebellum were also labelled. In many areas (e.g. in thalamic, midbrain and pontine nuclei) ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha expression became undetectable with maturation; however, there were other areas (e.g., olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus) where expression was higher in the adult. The neuroepithelium of the neonatal rat displayed a highly selective expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha in areas which are known to exhibit high rates of postnatal cell proliferation in the germinal zones. Generally, neurons which have been reported to respond to exogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor were labelled by the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha probe. This was not the case, however, for striatal and septal neurons. The results of this study suggest that ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha ligands have even broader functions than previously thought, acting on different neuronal populations in the developing and mature brain, respectively.',\n",

In the embryonic mouse brain, positive expression signals were detected only for the genes encoding PIPK Igamma and PIPK IIbeta in both the cerebral ventricular and mantle zones, with weaker signals in the former zone. On the other hand, the genes encoding all PIPKs were essentially detected in the external granule cell layer which represents the germinal zone for the neuronal granule cells. In the postnatal brain, among the seven PIPKs, the expression for genes encoding PIPK Igamma and IIbeta is evident in most gray matter, while the expression for the other five types was weak in the cortical gray matter and negligible in most non-cortical gray matter such as the diencephalon and brain stem nuclei. While the expression for most PIPKs in the mature hippocampus was distinct, the expression in the CA3 and the dentate gyrus was less definite for the genes encoding PIPK Ialpha and IIgamma, respectively. The distinct expression for the gene encoding PIPK IIalpha was detected in the postnatal white matter such as the cerebellar medulla, the corpus callosum, the hippocampal fimbriae, and the internal capsule.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Using multiple 35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes concurrently, the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-I-R) mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot hybridization in newborn and adult rat brain as a single species of approximately 11 kilobases. The probes were used to localize IGF-I-R mRNA by in situ hybridization in slices of adult rat brain. The highest levels of IGF-I-R mRNA expression were found in the glomerular and mitral cell body layers of the olfactory bulb, the granule cell body layers of the dentate gyrus and cerebellum, the pyramidal cell body layers of the piriform cortex and Ammon's horn, and the choroid plexus. The lowest levels of IGF-I-R mRNA expression were found in white matter. At the cellular level, IGF-I-R mRNA was expressed by a variety of neurons, by epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, and by ependymal cells of the third ventricle. Of the neuron types studied, the highest levels of IGF-I-R mRNA were consistently found in perikarya of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, in pyramidal cells of the piriform cortex and Ammon's horn, and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. There was a close congruency between the distribution of IGF-I binding and IGF-I-R mRNA at the regional level. Neuropil layers in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum contained a high level of IGF-I binding, whereas the adjacent cell body layers contained a high level of the IGF-I-R mRNA. We conclude that in these regions, IGF-I-R mRNA is synthesized in neuronal cell bodies, and the receptors are transported to axons and dendrites in adjacent synapse-rich layers, where appropriate IGF effects are achieved.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Amygdala-kindled seizures increase the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and CRF-binding protein in GABAergic interneurons of the dentate hilus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Kindling, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, induces a number of neuropeptides including corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). CRF itself can produce limbic seizures which resemble kindling in some aspects. However, tolerance to the convulsant effects of CRF develops rapidly. Hypothetically, this could be explained should seizures also induce the CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP), which has been postulated to restrict the actions of CRF. Therefore, in the present study, we used in situ hybridization to examine the effects of amygdala-kindled seizures on the mRNA levels of CRF and CRF-BP. Kindled seizures markedly elevated CRF and CRF-BP in the dentate gyrus of rats. CRF and CRF-BP were induced almost exclusively in GABAergic interneurons of the dentate hilus. The CRF and CRF-BP interneurons also expressed neuropeptide Y but not cholecystokinin. CRF appeared to have an excitatory role in the dentate gyrus as it decreased the afterhyperpolarization of dentate granule neurons. These results suggest that CRF may contribute to the development of amygdala kindling. However, the compensatory induction of CRF-BP may serve to limit the excitatory effects of CRF in the dentate gyrus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Glucocorticoids, acting via the mineralocorticoid receptor, are required for granule neuronal survival in the rat dentate gyrus. Whether this mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated neuroprotective effect has more general applicability is unknown. Here we report increased mineralocorticoid receptor expression in rat hippocampal and cortical neurons exposed in vitro to low levels of staurosporine and in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed in vivo to hypothermic transient global ischaemia. In both the cell culture system and the in vivo system increased mineralocorticoid receptor expression is associated with increased neuronal survival, and this increase is reversed by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism. Modulation of mineralocorticoid receptor gene expression may therefore be an important target for reduction of brain injury in conditions caused by cerebral ischaemia including brain damage following cardiac arrest and stroke.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the mature hippocampus, kainic acid seizures lead to excitotoxic cell death and synaptic reorganization in which granule cell axons (mossy fibers) form ectopic synapses on granule cell dendrites. In the present study, we examined the expression of four major, developmentally regulated protein kinase C (PKC) substrates (MARCKS, MLP, GAP-43, RC3), which have different subcellular and regional localizations in the hippocampus at several time points (6 hr, 12 hr, 18 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 5 days, or 15 days) following kainic acid seizures using in situ hybridization. Consistent with previous reports, following kainate seizures, GAP-43 mRNA expression exhibited a delayed and protracted elevation in the granule cell layer, which peaked at 24 hr, whereas expression in fields CA1 and CA3 remained relatively unchanged. Conversely, RC3 mRNA expression exhibited a delayed reduction in the granule cell layer that was maximal at 18 hr, as well as a reduction CA1 at 48 hr, whereas CA3 levels did not change. MARCKS mRNA expression in the granule cell layer and CA1 remained stable following kainate, although an elevation was observed in subfield CA3c at 12 hr. Similarly, MLP mRNA expression did not change in the granule cell layer or CA1 following kainate but exhibited a protracted elevation in subfields CA3b,c beginning at 6 hr post-kainate. Collectively these data demonstrate that different PKC substrate mRNAs exhibit unique expression profiles and regulation in the different cell fields of the mature hippocampus following kainic acid seizures and during subsequent synaptic reorganization. The expression profiles following kainate seizures bear resemblance to those observed during postnatal hippocampal development, which may indicate the recruitment of common regulatory mechanisms.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The stratum granulosum (SG) of the fascia dentata from 17 human epileptic hippocampi was assessed in terms of width, volumetric cell density (VCD) and percentage of cell loss to study the granule cell dispersion (GCD) phenomenon described by Houser. GCD was considered when three conditions were observed, the SG was wider than 120 microns, granule cell (GC) somata did not remain in close apposition to one another the normal clear boundary between the molecular layer and the SG was not maintained. GCD involved a partial zone of the SG in six cases and the whole SG in two cases. Dynorphin mRNA in-situ hybridization was performed in two cases and allowed us to affirm that dispersed cells are actually GC. A close correlation linked GCD, GC loss and VCD decrease in diffuse CA4, laminated CA4, CA3, CA2 and CA1. The discussion is focused on the possible causes of dispersion. Some arguments did not suggest for a migration arrest during development. Nevertheless, in one case, a cluster of horizontal cells in the inner part of the molecular layer could evoke the persistence of normally transient cells during ontogenesis. A neo-migration due to permissive phenomenon induced by gliogenesis, mossy fibers sprouting in the supra-granular layer and over-expression of growth factors is suggested from experimental data. Nevertheless a straining due to the tissue shrinkage observed in severe hippocampal sclerosis (HS) could also be involved in the origin of GCD.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'This study describes the regional and cellular expression of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, in rodent brain. A combination of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot techniques was employed to localize GLUT4 mRNA and protein to the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebellum, with the greatest level of expression being in the cerebellum. Estimates of the concentration of GLUT4 in cerebellar membranes indicate that this transporter isoform is present in significant amounts, relative to the other isoforms, GLUT1 and GLUT3. Cerebellar GLUT4 expression was increased in the genetically diabetic, hyperinsulinemic, db/db mouse relative to the non-diabetic control, and even higher levels were observed in db/db female than db/db male mice. Levels of expression of GLUT4 protein in cerebellum appear to respond to the level of circulating insulin, and are reduced in the hypoinsulinemic streptozotocin-diabetic rat. Exercise training also results in reduced insulin levels and comparably reduced levels of GLUT4 in the cerebellum. These studies demonstrate a chronic insulin-sensitive regulation of GLUT4 in rodent brain and raise the possibility of acute modulations of glucose uptake in these GLUT4 expressing cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synaptic activity induces a rapid transcriptional response that is essential for the establishment of long-term neuronal plasticity. Using a differential cloning technique, we have identified a gene induced by seizure activity in the brain as RB3. RB3 is a recently cloned gene belonging to the stathmin family of phosphoproteins. Like SCG10, RB3 is brain-specific, although in situ hybridization results show that the expression of RB3 is more ubiquitous than is that of SCG10. Using genomic DNA sequencing, we show that the 27 amino acid sequence unique to the RB3\" transcript is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon, exon 2\\'. Using a peptide antibody raised against exon 2\\' to detect RB3\" and an anti-Flag antibody to detect an epitope-tagged version of RB3, we show that both proteins are localized to the Golgi apparatus of transfected COS7 cells. Of particular interest, RB3 mRNA, but not SCG10 mRNA, is rapidly induced in the dentate gyrus granule layer of the hippocampus after electrically induced seizure activity as well as stimuli leading to long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, RB3 mRNA is induced in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with 250 ng/ml NGF. These results suggest that RB3 may play a role in activity-induced neuronal plasticity and neuronal differentiation.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Environmental enrichment inhibits spontaneous apoptosis, prevents seizures and is neuroprotective.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The mammalian brain has a high degree of plasticity, with dentate granule cell neurogenesis and glial proliferation stimulated by an enriched environment combining both complex inanimate and social stimulation. Moreover, rodents exposed to an enriched environment both before and after a cerebral insult show improved cognitive performance. One of the most robust associations of environmental enrichment is improved learning and memory in the Morris water maze, a spatial task that mainly involves the hippocampus. Furthermore, clinical evidence showing an association between higher educational attainment and reduced risk of Alzheimer and Parkinson-related dementia indicates that a stimulating environment has positive effects on cerebral health that may provide some resilience to cerebral insults. Here we show that in addition to its effects on neurogenesis, an enriched environment reduces spontaneous apoptotic cell death in the rat hippocampus by 45%. Moreover, these environmental conditions protect against kainate-induced seizures and excitotoxic injury. The enriched environment induces expression of glial-derived neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and increases phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic-AMP response element binding protein, indicating that the influence of the environment on spontaneous apoptosis and cerebral resistance to insults may be mediated through transcription factor activation and induction of growth factor expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"While interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been shown to produce a variety of effects in the CNS and has recently been implicated as an endogenous brain neurokine, little is known about the molecular biology of IL-2 receptors in normal brain. The present investigation provides the first evidence that mRNA for IL-2 receptor-beta (IL-2R beta), an essential subunit for signal transduction by peripheral immune cells, is expressed in normal murine forebrain. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning, a partial cDNA (349 bp) corresponding to the extracellular domain was cloned and found to have the identical sequence as the lymphocyte IL-2R beta. IL-2R beta mRNA expression was confirmed by a ribonuclease protection assay, and using in situ hybridization histochemistry, IL-2R beta mRNA was localized in the hippocampus where an intense signal was present over the neuron-rich granule cells of the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn. Moreover, cDNA clones obtained from two murine neuroblastoma cell lines exhibited the same sequence as IL-2R beta cDNA from normal brain. IL-2R beta gene expression was also detected in the frontal cortex and striatum using PCR. Further in situ hybridization studies will be important to extend this initial observation to determine the brain regional localization and cell-specific anatomy of IL-2R beta mRNA in the CNS.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Up-regulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 in hippocampal neurons with reduced seizure vulnerability.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Selective hippocampal cell loss and altered neurotransmitter receptor expression have been proposed as pathogenic mechanisms in the development of chronic mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Studies in animal models point to metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) as modulators of hippocampal epileptogenesis. In addition, mGluRs may constitute specific targets for the development of novel anticonvulsive drugs. As mGluR4 represents an inhibitory class III mGluR associated with the reduction of intracellular cyclic AMP levels and calcium influx, we have analyzed the regional and cellular expression of mGluR4 in surgical hippocampal specimens obtained from patients with TLE by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Although the hippocampi of control specimens (n = 11) were almost devoid of mGluR4 immunolabeling, all TLE specimens (n = 35) showed a striking up-regulation of mGluR4 immunoreactivity, in particular within the dentate gyrus. Immunoelectron microscopy localized the receptor protein to the periphery of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. In situ hybridization revealed increased transcript levels of mGluR4 in dentate granule cells and residual CA4 neurons of TLE specimens compared with controls. Our results suggest a potential role of mGluR4 in counteracting excitatory hippocampal activity and in modulating seizure-associated vulnerability of hippocampal neurons. These data may also provide a basis for pharmacological studies of mGluR4 agonists as potential novel drugs in the treatment of TLE.',\n",

However, the distribution and functions of IGFBPL-1 in the brain are not known. Thus, to clarify IGFBPL-1 expression profiles during development, we have investigated the expression patterns of IGFBPL-1 mRNA in developing mouse brains using in situ hybridization, focusing especially on the forebrain. On embryonic day (E)12, IGFBPL-1mRNA expressions were localized in the preplate of the neopallium, dorsal thalamus, the differentiating field of the epithalamus, and the hippocampus. On E14, strong expression was recognized in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and intermediate zone (IMZ) in the neopallium, hippocampus, the differentiating field of the epithalamus, and the dorsal thalamus. E14 expressions were generally the strongest among all the stages examined and signals decreased thereafter. At E16 and E18, IGFBPL-1mRNA was strongly detected in the hippocampus and the SVZ of the neopallium. In postnatal stages, mRNA was found only in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). Notably, at P20, expression was restricted to the deep fraction of the granule cell layer, the location of late-born DG neurons.',\n",

Using in situ hybridization, we found that tdt is expressed within neurons of the adult mouse brain. tdt mRNA was localized within pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, granule and polymorphic cells in the dentate gyrus, Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum, and cortical cells. Increased levels of tdt mRNA in the hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum were associated with rearing C57BL/6 mice, but not DBA/2 mice, in enriched environments. Unlike wild types (WT), tdt (-/-) mice did not show improvement in spatial learning and memory as a result of rearing in enriched environments. These results suggest that tdt may be involved in learning and memory saving.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Age-dependent changes in the expression of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR4 and mGluR7) were studied by quantitative in situ hybridization using male Fisher 344 rats 3, 12 and 25 months of age. Results indicate an early decrease in mGluR7 mRNA level in several cortical areas including the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. In the hippocampus, mGluR7 mRNA levels decreased in the CA1 region and the lower blade of the dentate gyrus. Moreover, significant decrease was found in the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus at 12 months of age. Other regions such as the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens showed no age-related changes in mGluR7 mRNA levels. Analysis of emulsion autoradiograms revealed a 36% decrease of mGluR7 mRNA in Purkinje neurons in the 12-month-old group and a 48% decline in the 25-month-old group as compared to the 3-month-old group. A substantial decrease in mGluR4 mRNA level was found in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum during aging. The difference between the young and aged groups exceeded 35%. These region-specific decreases may have important implication in some of the age-related changes in cognitive, motor and/or sensory functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Levels of heat-shock 70 mRNAs, relative to those of 18S rRNA, were quantitated in specific cell types of hippocampus of adult and aged rats subjected to identical heat shock regimens. Body temperature changes in response to the heat stress were no different in adult and aged rats. In control rats, as well as 3 h after initiation of heat shock in both adult and aged rats, relative levels of the constitutively synthesized heat-shock cognate 70 (hsc70) mRNA were highest in hippocampal neurons and much lower in glia. No heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNAs were present in any cell type of control adult or aged rats. In heat-shocked adult rats, the relative levels of the heat-shock-inducible hsp70 mRNAs were highest in a subpopulation of glia, intermediate in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and lowest in pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn. Relative levels of hsp70 mRNA were several-fold lower in the dentate gyrus granule cells of aged rats compared to relative levels in controls and were also reduced in many pyramidal cells of the hippocampus but not in hippocampal glia. These findings suggest that some neuronal populations in the hippocampus may be at increased risk for stress-related injury in the aged animal.\",\n",

Strong signals were obtained in neurons for GDF-1 and GDF-10. GDF-1 is expressed at postnatal day 6 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal CA1 through CA3 neurons, while only weakly expressed by cells in the dentate gyrus. Granule cells and neurons in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus are GDF-1-positive, as are the majority of neurons in the cortex. GDF-10 shows a distinct pattern of expression: At P6, strong labelling was seen in the superficial layers of cortex, notably in the posterior cingulate cortex, and in CA3 and dentate gyrus. From postnatal day 21, GDF-1 expression is strong in the hippocampus, cortex, and thalamic nuclei, while GDF-10 expression becomes restricted to the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus. In contrast, OP-1 expression is restricted throughout development to cells of the medial habenular nucleus, choroid plexus, and leptomeninges. The markedly different expression patterns of these BMPs suggest they serve separate functions in the brain.',\n",

Northern blots showed that all the territories studied express beta 2 transcripts, albeit with widely varying levels (with cerebellum >> hippocampus > brain > brainstem > spinal cord). In situ hybridization confirmed that in these structures, all the neuronal cell bodies contain beta 2 mRNA; expression was particularly high in the granule cells of the cerebellum, in both pyramidal cell layer and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, and in spinal cord motor neurons. Northern blots also showed that RNA extracted from optic nerve and cultured cortical astrocytes contained beta 2 mRNA, while it was totally absent from sciatic nerve. In situ hybridization evidenced the presence of a numerous population of beta 2-positive cells in cerebellum white matter, spinal cord white matter, and in corpus callosum, where frontal sections showed labelled cells arranged in the chain-like or row pattern typical of interfascicular oligodendrocytes. Combination of antiglial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunofluorescent histochemistry with detection of beta 2 mRNA evidenced that expression of the transcripts was indeed restricted to GFAP-negative cells in white matter.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Electrical kindling of the rat dorsal hippocampus induced significant changes in the binding of 125I-peptide YY to Y1 and Y2 subtypes of neuropeptide Y receptors and in their mRNA levels in the area dentata as assessed by quantitative receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Binding to Y1 receptor sites decreased by 50% (p < 0.05) in the molecular layer of the stimulated dentate gyrus, 2 days after preconvulsive stage 2 and 1 week or 1 month after generalized stage 5 seizures compared with sham-stimulated rats. Binding to Y2 receptor sites increased bilaterally by 36-87% (p < 0.05) in the hilus at stage 2 and 1 week or 1 month after stage 5. No significant changes were observed after one afterdischarge or in the other hippocampal subfields or in the cortex. Y1 receptor mRNA signal decreased bilaterally by 50-64% (p < 0.01) in the granule cell layer, 6 h but not 24 h after stages 2 and 5. The Y2 receptor mRNA signal was enhanced by 283% (p < 0.01) in the stimulated granule cell layer 24 h after stage 2. At 6 and 24 h after stage 5, mRNA levels were increased both ipsilaterally (283 and 360%, respectively; p < 0.01) and contralaterally (190 and 260%, respectively; p < 0.05). No significant changes in level of either mRNA was found following one afterdischarge. These modifications, and the enhanced neuropeptide Y release previously shown in the hippocampus, suggest that kindling is associated with lasting changes in neuropeptide Y-mediated neurotransmission.',\n",

We investigated the gene expression response of the Kv4.2 subtype of potassium channel, in the rat hippocampus, to a brief (5 min) episode of kainic acid-induced seizures. Our results demonstrate that Kv4.2 expression is reduced in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus at 3 h post-seizure, while no significant changes in expression are observed in other hippocampal subfields. At 6 h post-challenge, expression in both dentate hilar cells and granule cells is reduced, while no other significant changes are observed. At 24 h post-challenge, expression levels for Kv4.2 in the dentate granule cells have rebounded to levels greater than control, while expression levels are significantly reduced in the CA3 and CA4 subfields. No significant changes in Kv4.2 expression are observed in kainic acid-administered animals that fail to seize, indicating that the changes in gene expression result from seizure activity and not from the direct actions of the administered kainic acid.

       "  'Abstract': \"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its signal transducing receptor, the TrkB tyrosine protein kinase, are expressed at high levels in the hippocampus of the adult brain, suggesting a role for BDNF mechanisms in neuronal plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we used defined lesions of perforant path and fimbria-fornix, two major hippocampal afferents, to remove synapses on dendrites of dentate gyrus granule cells and pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn and induce synaptic rearrangements. These combined lesions remove afferent connections from entorhinal cortex and septum and produce massive sprouting of axons of the commissural/associational pathways into the molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. At days 1, 3, and 6, the lesions decreased BDNF mRNA expression ipsilaterally to approximately 50% of control, with complete recovery at 14 d. The lesions did not alter trkB mRNA levels in neuronal layers of the hippocampus; however, they resulted in a pronounced induction of trkB mRNA expression in hippocampal non-neuronal cells 6-14 d after lesioning. The induction corresponded in time and place to the synaptic reorganization in the lesioned hippocampus. The mRNA species newly induced by the lesions corresponded to those transcripts encoding the noncatalytic TrkB receptor isoform that lacks the cytoplasmic protein kinase domain. Expression of mRNAs coding for neurotrophin-3 and the TrkC tyrosine protein kinase were not altered by the lesions. The findings suggest that truncated noncatalytic TrkB molecules expressed on the surface of glial cells play an important role in plasticity of the adult brain, possibly regulating the concentration of bioactive neurotrophins or the responsiveness of neurotrophin receptors. Alternatively, they may play a role in presenting neurotrophin molecules to growing axons.\",\n",

GAD65 mRNA expression was enhanced in interneurons of the hippocampus in young IER, that had not yet developed generalized seizures. In older IER and older SER that both showed spontaneous seizures, marked increases of NPY mRNA in hippocampal granule cells and interneurons were found, as well as elevated GAD65 mRNA levels in interneurons. NPY immunoreactivity was enhanced in hilar interneurons and the dentate gyrus of older IER. In addition, some older IER stained heavily for NPY in mossy fibers.

       "  'Abstract': 'G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channels are coupled to a number of neurotransmitter receptors, including some monoamine receptors. In the present study we have investigated the effect of electroconvulsive shock on gene expression of the G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel subunits G-protein-coupled inward rectifier K+-channel (GIRK1) and GIRK2 in the rat brain using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Acute electroconvulsive shock (a single shock) increased GIRK2 expression while causing a transient reduction of the messenger RNA abundance of GIRK1 in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Chronic electroconvulsive shock (five shocks over 10 days) caused a larger increase in GIRK2 messenger RNA abundance, which was accompanied by an increase in GIRK2 immunoreactivity in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Unlike for acute electroconvulsive shock, GIRK1 messenger RNA abundance in the dentate gyrus was significantly increased after chronic electroconvulsive shock. No significant alterations in GIRK1 and GIRK2 messenger RNA abundance were detected in the other brain regions studied, including the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus, the frontal-parietal cortex and piriform cortex. The neuroanatomically specific changes in expression of the potassium channel subunits may directly influence neuronal excitability as well as the functions of G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is associated with changes in expression of a variety of different proteins and is thought to be the mechanism which underlies synaptic plasticity. The 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) is a presynaptic protein which is involved in neurotransmitter exocytosis at the nerve terminal. Two isoforms of SNAP-25 have so far been identified (a and b) which differ in their distribution and developmental regulation. Using in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the two isoforms of this protein are increased 2 h after the induction of LTP in granule cells of the dentate gyrus following high frequency stimulation of the perforant path in vivo. These observations further demonstrate the involvement of both isoforms of SNAP-25 in functional synaptic plasticity, although their exact roles have yet to be fully determined.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Long-term potentiation activates the GAP-43 promoter: selective participation of hippocampal mossy cells.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Perforant path long-term potentiation (LTP) in intact mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus increased the neuron-specific, growth-associated protein GAP-43 mRNA in hilar cells 3 days after tetanus, but surprisingly not in granule cells, the perforant path target. This increase was positively correlated with level of enhancement and restricted to central hilar cells on the side of stimulation. Blockade of LTP by puffing DL-aminophosphonovalerate (APV), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker into the molecular layer, eliminated LTP-induced GAP-43 mRNA elevation in hilar cells. To determine whether the mRNA elevation was mediated by transcription, LTP was studied in transgenic mice bearing a GAP-43 promoter-lacZ reporter gene. Promoter activity as indexed by Transgene expression (PATE) increased as indicated by blue staining of the lacZ gene product, beta-galactosidase. Potentiation induced a blue band bilaterally in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus along the entire septotemporal axis. Because mossy cells are the only neurons in the central hilar zone that project to the inner molecular layer bilaterally along the entire septotemporal axis and LTP-induced activation of PATE in this zone was confined to the side of stimulation, we concluded that mossy cells were unilaterally activated, increasing synthesis of beta-galactosidase, which was transported bilaterally. Neither granule cells nor pyramidal cells demonstrated increased PATE or increased GAP-43 mRNA levels. These results and recent evidence indicating the necessity of hilar neurons for LTP point to previously unheralded mossy cells as potentially critical for perforant path LTP and the GAP-43 in these cells as important for LTP persistence lasting days.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We describe here an LTP-induced gene, LIRF, which encodes a novel protein with RING finger and B30.2 domains in its N- and C-terminal portions, respectively. Each domain is encoded by one exon, suggesting that the organization of the gene was generated by exon shuffling. The amino acid sequences of the mouse, rat, and human LIRF proteins are highly conserved and contain a putative PEST sequence. LIRF is an immediate-early gene in hippocampal granule cells, and its expression is upregulated immediately after the induction of long-lasting long-term potentiation at perforant pathway-dentate gyrus synapses and returns to the basal level within 150 min. A heterologously expressed LIRF protein fused to EGFP localizes specifically to the cytoplasm in COS-7 cells. These findings suggest a possible involvement of LIRF in a limited, early phase of synaptic plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The trkB gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor which is an essential component of the high-affinity cell surface receptor for the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor. In this report we have used quantitative in situ hybridization to study the expression of trkB messenger RNA in the rat hippocampus following stimulation of afferents in the entorhinal cortex. A bilateral three-fold increase of trkB messenger RNA levels in the hippocampus was seen 4 h after quisqualate injection into the left entorhinal cortex. The increase was confined to the granule layer of the dentate gyrus. A small increase, however, was also seen bilaterally in the pyramidal cell layer. The increases in all hippocampal areas were completely prevented by pretreatment of the animals with systemic injection of diazepam but not with scopolamine. We suggest that glutamate release from cortical afferents to the hippocampus has the capacity to increase neuronal expression of trkB messenger RNA within the hippocampus. The results from the present study extend the interpretation of our previous evidence of cortical transynaptic activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA and indicate the presence of a concomitant activation of trkB messenger RNA expression in the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synapse development and injury-induced reorganization have been extensively characterized morphologically, yet relatively little is known about the underlying molecular and biochemical events. To examine molecular mechanisms of synaptic development and rearrangement, we looked at the developmental pattern of expression of the neuron-specific gene synapsin I in granule cell neurons of the dentate gyrus and their accompanying mossy fibers during the main period of synaptogenic differentiation in the rat hippocampus. We found a significant difference between the temporal expression of synapsin I messenger RNA in dentate granule somata and the appearance of protein in their mossy fiber terminals during the postnatal development of these neurons. Next, to investigate the regulation of neuron-specific gene expression during the restoration of synaptic contacts in the central nervous system, we examined the expression of the synapsin I gene following lesions of hippocampal circuitry. These studies show marked changes in the pattern and intensity of synapsin I immunoreactivity in the dendritic fields of dentate granule cell neurons following perforant pathway transection. In contrast, changes in synapsin I messenger RNA expression in target neurons, and in those neurons responsible for the reinnervation of this region of the hippocampus, were not found to accompany new synapse formation. On a molecular level, both developmental and lesion data suggest that the expression of the synapsin I gene is tightly regulated in the central nervous system, and that considerable changes in synapsin I protein may occur in neurons without concomitant changes in the levels of its messenger RNA. Finally, our results suggest that the appearance of detectable levels of synapsin I protein in in developing and sprouting synapses coincides with the acquisition of function by those central synapses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mRNAs for two forms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) were localized in the rat hippocampal formation by nonradioactive in situ hybridization methods with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes. Some neurons in all layers of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus were readily labeled for each GAD mRNA, and the patterns of labeling for GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs were very similar. All major groups of previously described GAD- and GABA-containing neurons appeared to be labeled for each GAD mRNA. Such findings suggest that most GABA neurons in the hippocampal formation contain both GAD mRNAs. When the labeling of neurons in the hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex was compared in the same sections, the intensity of neuronal labeling for GAD67 mRNA was generally similar in the two regions. However, the intensity of labeling for GAD65 mRNA was generally stronger for many neurons in the hippocampal formation than for most neurons in the cerebral cortex. Neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus were particularly well labeled for GAD65. The nonradioactive labeling for the GAD mRNAs was confined to the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies, and this allowed a clear visualization of the relative number and location of labeled neurons. Several distinct patterns of GAD mRNA-containing neurons were observed among different regions of the hippocampal formation. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus, GAD mRNA-containing neurons were numerous in the regions deep to the granule cell layer as well as in more central parts of the hilus. Within CA3, the densities (quantities) of labeled neurons varied among the regions. In the inner or hilar segment of CA3, the density of labeled neurons was often lower than that in the outer part of CA3 where numerous labeled neurons were distributed throughout all layers. In CA1, GAD mRNA-labeled neurons were distributed in a relatively laminar pattern with the highest density in stratum pyramidale and moderate densities in stratum oriens and at the interface between strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare. Lower densities were found within the latter two layers. The prominent localization of the two GAD mRNAs in the hippocampal formation suggests that a dual system for GABA synthesis is necessary for normal GABAergic function in this brain region. Most putative GABA neurons contain relatively high levels of GAD67 mRNA as might be expected if this GAD form is responsible for the synthesis of GABA for metabolic and baseline synaptic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization histochemistry in combination with RNA blot techniques was used to study the regulation of opioid gene expression in rat hippocampus. By use of a prodynorphin cDNA probe, a strong hybridization signal was identified in the granule cell layer of the hippocampus. However, experiments using a proenkephalin cDNA probe revealed that the content of proenkephalin mRNA was considerably lower than that of prodynorphin mRNA. Following five brief trains of high-frequency electrical stimulation to the dentate gyrus, the proenkephalin mRNA content of the granule cells, measured 22 hr later, was substantially increased on the stimulated side. In contrast, levels of prodynorphin mRNA were markedly decreased ipsilateral to the stimulation site. These results were confirmed by RNA blot analysis of extracted mRNA. The decrease in prodynorphin mRNA content first became apparent between 4 and 7 hr after the end of stimulation. Distinct mechanisms, therefore, regulate the expression of proenkephalin mRNA and prodynorphin mRNA in rat hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Human hippocampal AMPA and NMDA mRNA levels in temporal lobe epilepsy patients.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"This study was designed to determine whether hippocampal neuronal AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) mRNA levels were differentially increased in temporal lobe epilepsy patients compared with those measured in control tissue from non-seizure autopsies. Hippocampi from hippocampal sclerosis patients (n = 28) and temporal mass lesion cases (n = 12) were compared with those from the autopsies (n = 4), and studied for AMPA GluR1-3 and NMDAR1-2 mRNAs using semi-quantitative in situ hybridization, along with fascia dentata and Ammon's horn neuron densities. Compared with the autopsies, and without correction for neuron counts, the mass lesion cases with neuron densities similar to autopsies showed: (i) significantly increased NMDAR2 hybridization densities for fascia dentata granule cells; (ii) increased AMPA GluR3 mRNA densities for Ammon's horn pyramids; and (iii) similar or numerically increased mRNAs for all other subunits and hippocampal subfields. Compared with the autopsies, hippocampal sclerosis cases with decreased neuron densities showed: (i) significantly decreased AMPA GluR1-2 and NMDAR1-2 hybridization densities for Ammon's horn pyramids and (ii) similar or numerically decreased mRNAs for all other subunits and subfields. However, correcting for changes in neuron densities showed that hippocampal sclerosis patients had increased AMPA and NMDA mRNA levels per neuron compared with autopsies, and in the CA2 resistant sector GluR2 mRNA levels were numerically greater than autopsies and mass lesion cases. Furthermore, relative to autopsies both sclerosis and mass lesion hippocampi showed that, in the stratum granulosum, the greatest mRNA increases were in AMPA GluR1 and NMDAR2 compared with the other mRNAs. In chronic temporal lobe seizure patients these results indicate that mass lesion and sclerosis cases show differential increases in hippocampal AMPA and NMDA mRNA levels per neuron compared with autopsies, especially for AMPA GluR1 and NMDAR2 in fascia dentata granule cells. These findings support the hypothesis that temporal lobe seizures are associated with increased ionotropic glutamate receptor mRNA levels and alterations in receptor subunit composition that probably contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability, synchronization and seizure generation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization was used to determine 1) the relative concentrations of mRNAs encoding different subunits of the alpha-amino 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate receptor family in select regions of rat forebrain and 2) whether limbic seizures alter the balances of the subunit mRNAs. GluR1 and GluR2 mRNA levels were about equal and were much greater than GluR3 mRNA levels in the principal neurons of each hippocampal subdivision. Probable interneurons in hippocampal molecular layers had much higher levels of GluR1 mRNA than of either GluR2 or GluR3 mRNA. Pyramidal cell layers in neo- and paleocortex had a balance of mRNAs that was significantly different from the balance in hippocampus: GluR1 mRNA and GluR3 mRNA levels were about equal and were substantially lower than those of GluR2 mRNA. Lesion-induced limbic seizures caused transient changes in mRNA levels that were differentiated with regard to subunit and brain region. All three mRNAs were decreased in the pyramidal layers of cortex, and changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells were smaller. Seizure-induced changes in granule cells of the dentate gyrus differed from all other regions examined: GluR1 mRNA was reduced to a greater degree than GluR2 mRNA, whereas GluR3 mRNA content was markedly increased. These data strongly suggest that the subunit composition of alpha-amino 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors differs significantly between areas of the cortical telencephalon. Furthermore, the data indicate that aberrant patterns of physiological activity differentially influence the expression of subunit mRNAs in a region-specific and/or cell-type-specific manner.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Notch-DSL signaling system consists of multiple receptors and ligands, and plays many roles in development. The function of Notch receptors and ligands in mammalian brain, however, is poorly understood. In the current study, we examined the expression patterns for three receptors of this system, Notch1, 2, and 3, in late embryonic and postnatal rat brain by in situ hybridization. The three receptors have overlapping but different patterns of expression. Messenger RNA for all three proteins is found in postnatal central nervous system (CNS) germinal zones and, in early postnatal life, within numerous cells throughout the CNS. Within zones of cellular proliferation of the postnatal brain, Notch1 mRNA is found in both the subventricular and the ventricular germinal zones, whereas Notch2 and Notch3 mRNAs are more highly localized to the ventricular zones. Both Notch1 and Notch3 mRNAs are expressed along the inner aspect of the dentate gyrus, a site of adult neurogenesis. Notch2 mRNA is expressed in the external granule cell layer of the developing cerebellum. In several brain areas, Notch1 and Notch2 mRNAs are relatively concentrated in white matter, whereas Notch3 mRNA is not. Neurosphere cultures (which contain CNS stem cells), purified astrocyte cultures, and striatal neuron-enriched cultures express Notch1 mRNA. However, in these latter cultures, Notch1 mRNA is produced by nestin-containing cells, rather than by postmitotic neurons. Taken together, these results support multiple roles for Notch1, 2, and 3 receptor activation during CNS development, particularly during gliogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'GABA(B) receptors act to inhibit neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals, and mediate the late inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Studies of GABA(B) receptor function in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) suggest that GABA(B) receptor expression and/or function may be perturbed. GABA(B(1)) mRNA levels were investigated in 10 hippocampal resection samples obtained at surgery from intractable hippocampal sclerosis (HS) associated TLE patients and five neurologically normal post-mortem (PM) control samples. In situ hybridisation with a 35S-dATP-labelled oligonucleotide was carried out to measure mRNA levels, along with three-dimensional cell counting, for assessment of neuronal density in hippocampal subregions. GABA(B(1)) mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the subiculum of HS samples as compared with PM controls. When adjusted for the characteristic neuronal density changes observed in HS, GABA(B(1)) mRNA was significantly up-regulated in CA1, hilus and dentate gyrus granule cell layer of HS samples as compared with PM controls. The possibility of increased GABA(B(1)) expression suggests that changes in GABA(B) receptor mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of human HS-associated TLE.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The regulation of prodynorphin gene expression by glucocorticoids in the hippocampus was examined in rats that were adrenalectomized (ADX) either 7, 30, 60 and 90 days prior to sacrifice. Peptide levels in the hippocampus of ADX rats were determined by radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemistry. Prodynorphin (PDYN) mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. A time-dependent decrease in dynorphin A(1-8)(DYN) levels in the hippocampus (18% at 7 days; 44% at 30 days; 58% at 60 days) of ADX rats was found, which was accompanied by a comparable decrease in the abundance of PDYN mRNA. An in situ hybridization analysis revealed that both the number of positively hybridized cells and the number of silver grains per cell were decreased in the dentate gyrus after ADX. The administration of dexamethasone after surgery reversed the peptide and mRNA attenuation induced by ADX. ADX had no effect on the expression of proenkephalin mRNA or [Met5]-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Examination of thionin-counterstained tissue showed that the dentate granule cell layer was intact. The decrement of DYN expression in this system is proposed to have resulted from the removal of glucocorticoid input and not dentate granule cell loss. This study provides the strong evidence for a differential susceptibility of these two opioid peptides in the hippocampus to the removal of glucocorticoids. In addition, these data provide support for a potentially selective, glucocorticoid-permissive component in PDYN gene expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The GABA(A) receptor is a ligand gated chloride channel consisting of five membrane spanning proteins for which 13 different genes have been identified in the mammalian brain. The present review summarizes recent work from our laboratory on the characterization of the immunocytochemical distribution of these GABA(A) receptor subunits in the rat brain and changes in immunoreactivity and mRNA expression after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. A heterogeneous distribution of immunoreactive GABA(A) receptor subunits was observed. The most abundant ones were: alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, alpha5, beta2, beta3, gamma2, and delta. Alpha1, beta2, and gamma2 were about equally distributed in all subfields of the hippocampus; alpha4- and delta-subunits were preferentially found in the dentate molecular layer and in CA1; alpha2 was localized to the dentate molecular layer and CA3; alpha5 was found in the dendritic areas of CA1 to CA3; and beta1 was preferentially seen in CA2. Alpha1, beta2, gamma2 and delta were highly concentrated in interneurons. Kainic acid-induced seizures caused acute and chronic changes in the expression of mRNAs and immunoreactive proteins. Acute changes included decreases in alpha2, alpha5, beta1, beta3, gamma2 and delta mRNA levels (by about 25-50%), accompanied by increases (by about 50%) in alpha1, alpha4, and beta2 messages in granule cells (after 6-12 h). Chronic changes, characterized by losses in mRNA and immunoreactive proteins in CA1 and CA3, are undoubtedly due to seizure-related cell damage. However, compensatory expression of alpha2 and beta3 subunits, especially in CA3b/c, was observed. Furthermore, increases in mRNAs and immunoreactive proteins were seen for alpha1, alpha2 alpha4, beta1, beta2, beta3 and gamma2 in granule cells and in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at 7-30 days after kainic acid injection. The changes in the expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits, observed in practically all hippocampal subfields, may reflect altered GABA-ergic transmission during development of the epileptic syndrome. Increased expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the dendritic field of granule cells and CA3 suggest that GABA-ergic inhibition may be augmented at these levels. However, the lasting preservation of alpha1-, beta2-, and gamma2-subunits in interneurons could provide a basis for augmented inhibition of GABA-ergic interneurons, leading to net disinhibition.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of awake rats triggered a rapid (2 hour) elevation in tyrosine kinase receptor (trkB and trkC) gene expression and a delayed (6-24 hour) increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene expression. Depending on the mRNA species, LTP induction led to highly selective unilateral or bilateral increases in gene expression. Specifically, trkB and NT-3 mRNA elevations were restricted to granule cells in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus, whereas bilateral increases in trkC, BDNF, and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA levels occurred in granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells. Both unilateral and bilateral changes in gene expression were N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent and LTP-specific. Bilateral electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that LTP was unilaterally induced; this was corroborated by a dramatic unilateral increase in the expression of the immediate early gene zif/268, a marker for LTP, restricted to the ipsilateral granule cells. The results indicate that LTP triggers an interhemispheric communication manifested as selective, bilateral increases in gene expression at multiple sites in the hippocampal network. Furthermore, our findings suggest that physiological plastic changes in the adult brain may involve coordinated, time-dependent regulation of multiple neurotrophin and trk receptor genes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cellular localization of rat brain sodium channel alpha-subunit mRNAs I, II and III in the central nervous system (CNS) was examined by non-isotope in situ hybridization cytochemistry utilizing two independent sets of isoform-specific RNA probes, one set recognizing sodium channel isoforms in the coding region and the other in the non-coding region of the sodium channel messages. The independent sets of probes demonstrated qualitatively similar patterns of sodium channel mRNA expression. In the hippocampus, sodium channel mRNA I was very weakly expressed in the pyramidal layer and in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus; in contrast, sodium channel mRNA II was strongly expressed by neurons in these regions. Sodium channel mRNA III exhibited low-to-moderate expression in some neurons of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and granular layer of the dentate gyrus, and was not detectable in others. In the cerebellum, sodium channel mRNA I was moderately expressed in some Purkinje cells, weakly expressed in scattered cells in the molecular layer and negligibly expressed in the granular layer. Sodium channel mRNA II was strongly expressed in Purkinje and granule cells, and was moderately expressed in some cells in the molecular layer. Sodium channel mRNA III was generally not detectable in the cerebellum. In the spinal cord, motor neurons and scattered neurons throughout the gray matter exhibited moderate-to-strong expression of both sodium channel mRNA I and II. A population of cells in the spinal zone of Lissauer showed heavy expression of mRNA II, but not mRNA I. Sodium channel mRNA III was not detectable in spinal cord neurons. These observations are consistent with a general regional distribution of sodium channel message isoforms, with mRNA II being preferentially expressed in rostral regions of the CNS and mRNA I in caudal regions. However, the results also indicate that different cell types, within a given region, display different patterns of sodium channel mRNA expression. Moreover, these data suggest that individual neurons may express multiple forms of sodium channel mRNA.',\n",

Fetal rat src mRNA levels were much higher in the central nervous system than any peripheral organ. In adult brain, src+ mRNA level was highest in the internal granular layer of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and cerebellar granule cells. src+ and src- levels were similar in hindbrain, but src+ levels were higher than those of src- in forebrain.

       "  'Abstract': 'Levels of messenger RNAs for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3, and their high-affinity receptors, TrkB and TrkC, were analysed in the brains of genetically fast and slow kindling rats using in situ hybridization. Basal expression of neurotrophins and Trk messenger RNAs in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, frontoparietal and piriform cortices did not differ between the two strains. At 2 h after the third generalized grade 5 seizure, induced by kindling stimulations in the amygdala, increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA was detected in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, amygdala, frontoparietal and piriform cortices of the fast kindlers. Similar seizure-evoked increases of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels were also observed in the amygdala and piriform cortex of slow kindlers. However, in these animals, brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA expression was not significantly altered by the seizures in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and frontoparietal cortex. Furthermore, the seizure-induced increase of nerve growth factor, TrkB and TrkC messenger RNAs and decrease of neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA levels in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer was only observed in fast, but not in slow, kindlers. The neurotrophins are believed to regulate synaptic plasticity and efficacy and to facilitate long-term potentiation and kindling epileptogenesis. The present data suggest that the slow and fast kindling rates in the two strains studied here might partly be due to differences in seizure-evoked neurotrophin and Trk synthesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"We describe the cloning and characterization of a novel rat gene, bwd (brain-enriched WD), which encodes a protein with four copies of the WD amino acid motif, suggesting involvement in protein-protein interaction and a regulatory function in the cell. Northern analysis reveals two size classes of mRNA (1.8 and 2.2 kb), expressed in many adult tissues and developmental stages. Expression is highest in brain, where the longer of the two RNAs predominates. cDNA sequences show that both RNAs encode the identical protein, differing only in their 3' untranslated regions, where the longer transcript contains two RNA instability signals (AUUUA). In situ hybridization to bwd RNA in adult brain shows a highly restricted pattern, localizing expression mainly to the Purkinje and granule neurons of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and the dentate gyrus. In cryosections of rat cerebellum and kidney, BWD is shown by immunohistochemistry to be localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons, and in predominantly the cytoplasm of cells surrounding kidney ducts. Taken together, these results suggest a specialized function for BWD in the brain. Sequence similarity comparisons with bwd reveal structural homologs of unknown function in human, mouse, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and C. elegans, and provide evidence that this set of sequences forms a new subfamily of WD-repeat genes. By sequence comparisons with expressed sequence tags (ESTs), the human homolog of bwd is predicted to reside in the chromosome 1q12-23 region, where several genetic diseases are known to map.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors are implicated in several neuropathological conditions including epilepsy. As a model of complex partial seizures, rapid hippocampal kindling was chosen to investigate changes in the expression of messenger RNAs encoding the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B both during and in the period immediately following the induction of the kindled state. The study demonstrates a cell-specific, time-dependent modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit messenger RNAs almost entirely restricted to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In partially kindled animals (10 stimulations), while the NR1 subunit messenger RNA remained unaltered after a period of 2 h, the NR2A and NR2B subunit messenger RNAs were bilaterally reduced in dentate gyrus granule cells by around 50% below control values. In fully kindled animals (40 stimulations), a progressive reduction in NR1 subunit messenger RNA levels in the dentate gyrus was observed, being maximal after 4 h (-67%). At the same time point, NR2A and NR2B transcript levels were transiently increased by 102% and 46% above control values, respectively. These data point to a differential regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit messenger RNAs. No alterations were detected in pyramidal cells. Long-term maintenance of the kindled state was not associated with alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit messenger RNAs since control levels of messenger RNA were attained by 12 h and persisted for at least five days. The early changes in messenger RNAs described in this study indicate that the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunits is under independent regulatory control. This phenomenon may contribute to epileptogenesis and to kindling-associated plasticity by mediating a structural reorganization of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors, leading to an altered excitability of dentate gyrus granule cells.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Cholinergic sprouting in the rat fascia dentata after entorhinal lesion is not linked to early changes in neurotrophin messenger RNA expression.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'After unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion cholinergic septohippocampal fibres sprout in the denervated fascia dentata. This process is dependent on neurotrophin changes following the lesion. Thus, there is an up-regulation of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA expression in the denervated granule cells which is detectable 4 h postlesion and returns to control levels by 24 h. Here, using a competitive polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization, a transient neurotropin messenger RNA increase could be demonstrated bilaterally following unilateral electrolytic entorhinal cortex lesion. Treatment of the animals with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate blocked this messenger RNA increase, suggesting an involvement of this receptor type in the neurotrophin changes. However, in spite of this blockade, the typical cholinergic sprouting response as visualized with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry was present in animals four weeks after entorhinal cortex lesion. These data suggest that brief initial changes in neurotrophin messenger RNA expression in dentate granule cells are not responsible for the induction of the cholinergic sprouting. Changes in neurotrophin messenger RNA expression occurring immediately postlesion may be linked to glutamate release from entorhinal terminals resulting from the electrolytic lesion of the projection cells in the entorhinal cortex. We hypothesize that later changes in neurotrophin expression, for example in glial cells, are more likely to be related to the cholinergic sprouting process.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Development of kindling and mossy fiber sprouting, and changes of gene expression were studied after 40 seizures produced during about 3 h by electrical stimulation every 5 min in the ventral hippocampus. As assessed by 5 test stimulations, enhanced responsiveness was present already after 6-24 h but from 1 week post-seizure increased gradually up to 4 weeks without additional stimuli. Sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus was demonstrated only at 4 weeks with Timm's staining. In situ hybridization showed a transient increase (maximum at 2 h) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkB and TrkC mRNA levels and reduction (maximum at 12-24 h) of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA expression in dentate granule cells after the seizures. In addition, BDNF mRNA levels were elevated in CA1 and CA3 regions, amygdala and piriform cortex. Marked increases of mRNA for growth-associated protein (GAP-43), with maximum expression at 12-24 h, were observed in dentate granule cells and in amygdala-piriform cortex. Dynorphin mRNA levels showed biphasic changes in dentate granule cells with an increase at 2 h followed by a decrease at 24 h. No long-term alterations of gene expression were observed. These findings indicate that increased responsiveness develops rapidly after recurring seizures but that the kindled state is reached gradually in about 4 weeks. Mossy fiber sprouting occurs in parallel to epileptogenesis and may play a causative role. Short-term changes of neurotrophin and Trk, GAP-43 and dynorphin mRNA levels and the assumed alterations of the corresponding proteins could trigger structural rearrangements underlying kindling but might also contribute to the initial increase of seizure susceptibility.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kalirin is a multifunctional protein identified by its interaction with peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, an enzyme essential for neuropeptide biosynthesis. Several forms of Kalirin exist, all containing spectrin-like repeats, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, and an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain; several different COOH-termini provide additional DH/PH domains and a putative protein kinase. Kalirin binds Rac1 and affects cytoskeletal organization, neuropeptide secretion, and iNOS activity. By in situ hybridization, the highest levels of Kalirin mRNA were found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and Purkinje cells, with high levels also in thalamus, caudate putamen, septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and anterior olfactory nucleus. Low levels of Kalirin mRNA were detected in the paraventricular, supraoptic, and reticular thalamic nuclei and in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Brain areas with high levels of Kalirin mRNA showed strong Kalirin-like immunoreactivity. Pyramidal neurons with strongly staining soma and long dendrites were observed primarily in layer 5 of the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, a uniform distribution of neurons with fine dendritic staining was observed in the pyramidal cell layer, in the granule cell layer, and in the hilar cells of the dentate gyrus as well as in isolated interneurons. Cerebellar Purkinje neurons exhibited intense staining in the soma and in extensive dendritic arbors extending to the surface of the molecular layer. During embryonic development, Trio, the Drosophila orthologue of Kalirin, plays an essential role in axon guidance; localization of Kalirin to the somatodendritic region of adult neurons provides the basis for future studies of regulation and function.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the kindling model of epilepsy, repeated electrical stimulations lead to progressive and permanent intensification of seizure activity. We find that the development of amygdala kindling is markedly retarded in mice heterozygous for a deletion of the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene (NT-3+/- mice). These mice did not reach the fully kindled state (3rd grade 5 seizure) until after 28 +/- 4 days of stimulation compared to 17 +/- 2 days in the wild-type animals. The deficit in the NT-3+/- mice reflected dampening of the progression from focal to generalized seizures. The number of stimulations required to evoke focal (grade 1 and 2) seizures did not differ between the groups, but the NT-3 mutants spent a considerably longer period of time (13 +/- 3 days) than wild-type mice (2 +/- 1 days) in grade 2 seizures. As assessed by test stimulation 4-12 weeks after the 10th grade 5 seizure, kindling was maintained in the NT-3 mutants. In situ hybridization showed 30% reduction of basal NT-3 mRNA levels and lack of upregulation of TrkC mRNA expression at 2 h after a generalized seizure in dentate granule cells of the NT-3+/- mice, whereas the seizure-evoked increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB mRNA levels was enhanced. These results indicate that endogenous NT-3 levels can influence the rate of epileptogenesis, and suggest a link between NT-3 and BDNF gene regulation in dentate granule cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to modulate synaptic function as well as to promote neuronal growth in the adult brain. The aim of the present study was to compare the duration of electroconvulsive shock (ECS)-induced BDNF gene expression following a single shock (acute ECS) to the more clinically relevant situation, where repeated shocks (chronic ECS) are administered. For this purpose, we have used quantitative in situ hybridisation with a 35S-labelled oligonucleotide probe complementary to mRNAs encoding genes for all forms of BDNF. The results confirm previous studies that the administration of ECS increases BDNF mRNA abundance in parts of rat brain with particularly marked changes in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. We also for the first time show the long lasting nature of the increase in BDNF mRNA abundance measured after chronic ECS, i.e., significant increases in BDNF mRNA persisted up to 48 h after the last shock. Acute ECS at 6 h after the shock produced a slightly more pronounced effect on BDNF mRNA abundance than chronic ECS 6 h after the last shock. However, this change was not detectable already 24 h after a single ECS. These results indicate that repeated ECS induces adaptive changes in BDNF mRNA expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The type I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu1) messenger RNA and protein are known to be widely expressed in rat brain, but knowledge of the regional expression of splice variants other than mGlu1a is limited. Probes were designed for in situ hybridization that specifically recognize each of the carboxy-terminal splice variants mGlu1a, -1b, -1c and -1d. The novel rat mGlu1d sequence was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and the predicted protein is highly homologous to the human sequence but contains both conservative and radical substitutions and is slightly longer (912 vs 908 amino acids). Each rat mGlu1 splice variant messenger RNA was found in a unique expression pattern. The messenger RNA encoding mGlu1a was abundant in cerebellar Purkinje cells and in mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb. Strong expression was also detected in hippocampal interneurons, and neurons of the thalamus and substantia nigra, while moderate expression was found in colliculi and cerebellar granule cells. The mGlu1b messenger RNA was strongly expressed in Purkinje cells, hippocampal pyramidal neurons, dentate gyrus granule cells and lateral septum, and moderately expressed in striatal, superficial cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. The mGlu1d messenger RNA was expressed in all regions where mGlu1a and -1b were detected; abundant in Purkinje cells, mitral and tufted cells, and hippocampal principal neurons and interneurons, strong in thalamus and substantia nigra, and moderate in lateral septum, cortex, striatum and colliculi. Human mGlu1 splice variant expression in the cerebellum matched that found for the rat. No specific signal was found with a probe capable of hybridizing to the rat mGlu1c splice junction, although another probe designed against a more 3' sequence of mGlu1c gave strong signals in the cerebellum and hippocampus, and moderate signals in thalamus and colliculi. It is concluded that mGlu1d messenger RNA is widely expressed, that mGlu1a and -1b messenger RNAs are expressed in almost complementary patterns and that formation of the mGlu1c splice junction is a rare event.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The NMDA receptor has been implicated in opioid tolerance and withdrawal. The effects of continuous infusion of butorphanol on the modulation of NMDA receptor subunit NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C gene expression were investigated by using in situ hybridization technique. Continuous intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with butorphanol (26 nmol/microl/h) resulted in significant modulations in the NRI, NR2A, and NR2B mRNA levels. The level of NR1 mRNA was significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and CA1 area of hippocampus in butorphanol tolerant and withdrawal (7 h after stopping the infusion) rats. The NR2A mRNA was significantly decreased in the CA1 and CA3 of hippocampus in tolerant rats and increased in the cerebral cortex and dentate gyrus in butorphanol withdrawal rats. NR2B subunit mRNA was decreased in the cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, thalamus, CA3 of hippocampus in butorphanol withdrawal rats. No changes of NR1, NR2A, NR2C subunit mRNA in the cerebellar granule cell layer were observed in either butorphanol tolerant or withdrawal rats. Using quantitative ligand autoradiography, the binding of NMDA receptor ligand [3H]MK-801 was increased significantly in all brain regions except in the thalamus and hippocampus, at the 7 hr after stopping the butorphanol infusion. These results suggest that region-specific changes of NMDA receptor subunit mRNA (NR1 and NR2) as well as NMDA receptor binding ([3H]MK-801) are involved in the development of tolerance to and withdrawal from butorphanol.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene expression is known to be modulated in the mossy fiber projection of hippocampal granule cells following seizure. We investigated NPY biosynthesis and metabolism in an attempt to characterize NPY biochemically as a neurotransmitter in the granule cell mossy fiber projection. NPY biosynthesis was compared in normal control animals and in animals that had experienced a single pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure. In situ hybridization analysis established the postseizure time course of preproNPY mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation, localizing the majority of increased preproNPY mRNA content to the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Radioimmunoassay analysis of the CA3/mossy fiber terminal subfield confirmed a subsequent increase in NPY peptide content. Biosynthesis of NPY peptide by granule cells and transport to the CA3/mossy fiber subfield was demonstrated by in vivo radiolabel infusion to the dentate gyrus/hilus followed by sequential HPLC purification of identified radiolabeled peptide from the CA3/mossy fiber terminal subfield. Additional in vivo radiolabeling studies revealed a postseizure increase in an unidentified NPY-like immunoreactive (NPY-LI) species. HPLC/radioimmunoassay analyses of CA3 subfield tissue extracts comparing normal control animals and pentylenetetrazole-treated animals confirmed the increased total NPY-LI, and demonstrated that the increased NPY-LI was comprised of a minor increase in native NPY and a major increase in the unknown NPY-LI. Data from subsequent and separate analyses incorporating immunoprecipitation with anti-C-terminal flanking peptide of NPY, further HPLC purification, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry support the conclusion that the unknown NPY-LI is methionine sulfoxide NPY. NPY and NPY-sulfoxide displayed differential calcium sensitivity for release from mossy fiber synaptosomes. Similar to NPY, NPY sulfoxide displayed high-affinity binding to each of the cloned Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5 receptor subtypes. Postrelease inactivation of NPY was demonstrated in a mossy fiber synaptosomal preparation. Thus, the present study in combination with previously reported electrophysiological activity of NPY in the CA3 subfield demonstrates that NPY fulfills the classical criteria for a neurotransmitter in the hippocampal granule cell mossy fiber projection, and reveals the presence of two molecular forms of NPY that display differential mechanisms of release while maintaining similar receptor potencies.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Extracellular signal regulated kinases. Localization of protein and mRNA in the human hippocampal formation in Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"MAP kinases (MAPK) are a family of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases that link cell surface signals to changes in enzyme activity and gene expression. They are the products of the newly described gene family referred to as extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs). Moreover, MAPKs phosphorylate tau in vitro at Ser/Thr Proline sites, generating a multiply phosphorylated tau protein that is similar to the hyperphosphorylated tau found in Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). We studied MAPK immunoreactivity and in situ hybridization patterns of the two major genes that comprise MAPK activity, ERK1 and ERK2, in the human hippocampal formation. Our goal was to determine whether the pattern of ERK expression is consistent with the hypothesis that MAPKs contribute to NFT formation. ERK1 mRNA is present in small amounts and confined primarily to dentate gyrus granule cells. ERK2 mRNA, by contrast, gives a much stronger hybridization signal and is present in dentate gyrus granule cells and pyramidal cells throughout all hippocampal subfields and adjacent temporal neocortex. Quantitative measures of ERK2 mRNA reveal that NFT-bearing neurons contain approximately 15% less ERK2 mRNA than nearest neighbors that do not contain NFT. NFT-bearing neurons contain approximately 25% less polyA mRNA, suggesting a relative preservation of ERK2 mRNA even in metabolically compromised cells. MAPK immunoreactivity (which represents both ERK1 and ERK2) is seen in neuronal soma, dendrites, axons, and in reactive astrocytes. In Alzheimer's disease, neurons that contain NFTs are also MAPK immunoreactive, but neurons that contain the highest amounts of MAPK immunoreactivity are not necessarily vulnerable for NFT. MAPK immunoreactivity is present in the same neurons as NFT and in the same subcellular compartments as tau, supporting a role for MAPKs in tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease. However, the presence of ERK immunoreactivity is not sufficient to predispose neurons to NFT formation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is increasingly used as a therapeutic tool in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, and we recently found that it has a neuroprotective effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects are still unknown. We investigated the effects of long-term rTMS on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cholecystokinin (CCK), and neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) mRNA in rat brain. In situ hybridization revealed a significant increase in BDNF mRNA in the hippocampal areas CA3 and CA3c, the granule cell layer, as well as in the parietal and the piriform cortex after rTMS. BDNF-like immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the same areas. A significant increase in CCK mRNA was observed in all brain regions examined. NPY mRNA expression, in contrast, was not altered. The present results suggest that BDNF may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of rTMS. Furthermore, the rTMS-induced changes in BDNF and CCK expression are similar to those reported after antidepressant drug treatment and electroconvulsive seizures, suggesting that a common molecular mechanism may underlie different antidepressant treatment strategies.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies have demonstrated that seizure activity causes a dramatic increase in neuropeptide expression in specific regions of the rat hippocampus. In this study we investigated the effect of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) on the expression of three posttranslational processing enzymes involved in the production of many bioactive peptides from their inactive precursors. Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) converts peptidylglycine substrates into alpha-amidated products and prohormone convertases 1 and 2 perform the tissue-specific endoproteolytic cleavage of many prohormones. After a single ECT, in situ hybridization demonstrated a rapid increase in the level of PAM mRNA in the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus, reaching peak levels between 1 and 4 h and then returning to near baseline levels within 24 h. Northern blot analysis confirmed the changes in PAM mRNA expression seen by using in situ hybridization. Similar rapid changes in PAM mRNA expression were seen after repeated ECT, suggesting that chronic ECT did not affect the regulation of PAM expression in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated an increase in PAM protein in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at 4 and 8 h after a single ECT. Based on in situ hybridization, levels of mRNA for the prohormone convertases 1 and 2 were also increased in dentate granule cells after a single ECT. Prohormone convertase 2 mRNA levels exhibited a slower response to ECT, not reaching maximal levels until 8 h after ECT. The response of the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus to ECT provides a model system for studying the rapid, coordinate regulation of peptide-processing enzymes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is an alpha-chemokine that stimulates migration of haematopoietic progenitor cells and development of the immune system. SDF-1 is also abundantly and selectively expressed in the developing and mature CNS, as we show here. At embryonic day 15, SDF-1 transcripts were detected in the germinal periventricular zone and in the deep layer of the forming cerebral cortex. At birth, granule cells in the cerebellum and glial cells of the olfactory bulb outer layer showed an SDF-1 in situ hybridization signal that decreased progressively within the next 2 weeks. In other regions such as cortex, thalamus and hippocampus, SDF-1 transcripts detected at birth progressively increased in abundance during the postnatal period. SDF-1 protein was identified by immunoblot and/or immunocytochemistry in most brain regions where these transcripts were detected. SDF-1 was selectively localized in some thalamic nuclei and neurons of the fifth cortical layer as well as in pontine and brainstem nuclei which relay the nociceptive response. The presence of SDF-1 transcripts in cerebellar granule cells was correlated with their migration from the external to the inner granular layers with disappearance of the signal when migration was completed. In contrast, SDF1 mRNA signal increased during formation of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and stayed high in this region throughout life. The selective and regulated expression of SDF-1 in these regions suggests a role in precursor migration, neurogenesis and, possibly, synaptogenesis. Thus this alpha chemokine may be as essential to nervous system function as it is to the immune system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'NeuroD/BETA2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has been shown to play a role in tissue-specific differentiation of pancreatic and enteroendocrine cells. To gain further insight into the function of neuroD/BETA2 in the nervous system development, we examined the expression pattern of neuroD/BETA2 during embryonic and postnatal development by using in situ hybridization. Dynamic changes of neuroD/BETA2 expression in the central nervous system were observed during embryogenesis, especially in telencephalon, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, and olfactory epithelium. Moderate level of expression was also detected in developing pancreas in early embryogenesis. Although the neuroD/BETA2 expression in cerebellum and hippocampus increased over time, expression in cerebral cortex, spinal cord, as well as in fetal pancreas gradually decreased as embryogenesis proceeded. High level of the neuroD/BETA2 expression in developing cerebellum and hippocampus persisted throughout postnatal development and remained at a stable level in the adult brain. Interestingly, neuroD/BETA2 expression was detected not only in postmitotic but also in mitotic cells, as was evident in its expression in external granular layer of cerebellum and granule cells of the dentate gyrus during postnatal development. This observation suggests that neuroD/BETA2 may have a unique role in proliferation, differentiation, or both, of granule cells of cerebellum and dentate gyrus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Levels of messenger RNA for nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and the tyrosine kinase receptors trkA, trkB and trkC have been studied using in situ hybridization in the rat brain 2 h and four weeks after kindling-induced seizures. Epileptiform activity evoked by hippocampal stimulation and exceeding 70 s lead to a concomitant and transient increase of brain- derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, trkB and trkC messenger RNA expression in dentate granule cells after both focal and generalized seizures. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels were also increased bilaterally in the CA1-CA3 regions, amygdala and the piriform, entorhinal, perirhinal, retrosplenial and temporal cortices after generalized seizures. The magnitude of the increases was similar throughout the development of kindling and in the fully kindled brain. No changes of trkA messenger RNA were observed. In amygdalar kindling, elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels developed more rapidly in the amygdala-piriform cortex than after stimulation in the hippocampus but changes in the hippocampal formation were only seen in few animals. Intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine or a bilateral fimbria-fornix lesion did not alter basal expression or seizure-evoked changes in messenger RNA levels for neurotrophins or trk receptors but increased the number of animals exhibiting elevated levels after the first stimulation, probably due to a prolongation of seizure activity. Both in sham-operated and fimbria-fornix-lesioned rats seizure activity caused a marked reduction of neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA levels in dentate granule cells. The results indicate that activation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene, at least in dentate granule cells, is an \"all-or-none\" type of response and dependent on the duration but not the severity of seizures or the stage of kindling epileptogenesis. Changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3 and trkB and trkC were observed concomitantly in the dentate gyrus, which suggests that seizure activity sets in motion a cascade of genomic events possibly mediated via a common mechanism. Since altered messenger RNA levels outside hippocampus were detected only for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin and trk gene expression in these regions seems to be regulated differently.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"In central nervous system injury and disease, apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; apoE, protein) might be involved in neuronal injury and death indirectly through extracellular effects and/or more directly through intracellular effects on neuronal metabolism. Although intracellular effects could clearly be mediated by neuronal uptake of extracellular apoE, recent experiments in injury models in normal rodents and in mice transgenic for the human APOE gene suggest the additional possibility of intraneuronal synthesis. To examine whether APOE might be synthesized by human neurons, we performed in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded and frozen brain sections from three nondemented controls and five Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes to human APOE. Using the antisense APOE probes, we found the expected strong hybridization signal in glial cells as well as a generally fainter signal in selected neurons in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In hippocampus, many APOE mRNA-containing neurons were observed in sectors CA1 to CA4 and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. In these regions, APOE mRNA containing neurons could be observed adjacent to nonhybridizing neurons of the same cell class. APOE mRNA transcription in neurons is regionally specific. In cerebellar cortex, APOE mRNA was seen only in Bergmann glial cells and scattered astrocytes but not in Purkinje cells or granule cell neurons. ApoE immunocytochemical localization in semi-adjacent sections supported the selectivity of APOE transcription. These results demonstrate the expected result that APOE mRNA is transcribed and expressed in glial cells in human brain. The important new finding is that APOE mRNA is also transcribed and expressed in many neurons in frontal cortex and human hippocampus but not in neurons of cerebellar cortex from the same brains. This regionally specific human APOE gene expression suggests that synthesis of apoE might play a role in regional vulnerability of neurons in AD. These results also provide a direct anatomical context for hypotheses proposing a role for apoE isoforms on neuronal cytoskeletal stability and metabolism.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin induces an efficient and specific lesion of low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor-bearing cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. Intraventricular injection of 192 IgG-saporin, which caused a complete loss of cholinergic afferents to the hippocampus and neocortex and a partial denervation of amygdala and piriform cortex, was found to markedly facilitate the initial stages of seizure development in hippocampal kindling. In contrast, the progression of kindling process from focal to generalized seizures was not affected. In situ hybridization demonstrated that basal levels of brain-derived neutrotrophic factor messenger RNA in the hippocampal formation and piriform cortex were significantly decreased by the lesion, which also attenuated the seizure-induced increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. In the dentate gyrus, the 192 IgG-saporin lesion selectively reduced the upregulation of messenger RNAs for brain-derived neurotrophic factor exons I and III after a generalized seizure, whereas the increase of exon II messenger RNA was unchanged. The lesion abolished the seizure-evoked increase of nerve growth factor and TrkC messenger RNA levels and decrease of neutrophin-3 messenger RNA expression in dentate granule cells, while TrkB messenger RNA levels were not affected. We conclude that the basal forebrain cholinergic system (1) suppresses kindling epileptogenesis in the hippocampus, and (2) enhances both basal and seizure-evoked brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis in the hippocampal formation and some cortical areas through a specific pattern of activation of promoters within the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cerebroglycan is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked integral membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan found exclusively in the developing nervous system. In the rodent, cerebroglycan mRNA first appears in regions containing newly generated neurons and typically disappears 1 to several days later (Stipp et al., 1994, J. Cell Biol. 124:149-160). To gain insight into the roles that cerebroglycan plays in the developing nervous system, monospecific antibodies were prepared and used to localize cerebroglycan protein. In the rat, cerebroglycan was prominantly expressed on axon tracts throughout the developing brain and spinal cord, where it was found at times when axons are actively growing, but generally not after axons have reached their targets. Cerebroglycan was also found on neuronal growth cones both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, cerebroglycan immunoreactivity was rarely seen in or around neuronal cell bodies. Indeed, by examining the hippocampus at a late stage in development-when most neurons no longer express cerebroglycan but newly generated granule neurons do-evidence was obtained that cerebroglycan is strongly polarized to the axonal, and excluded from the somatodendritic, compartment of neurons. The timing and pattern of cerebroglycan expression are consistent with a role for this cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan in regulating the growth or guidance of axons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We used in situ hybridization for the detection of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) mRNAs combined with immunocytochemistry against the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PARV), calbindin 28k (CALB), and calretinin (CALR) to determine the expression of neurotrophins in functionally distinct subsets of hippocampal interneurons. Most PARV-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus were NGF mRNA-positive (82%), which corresponds to 71% of NGF-positive neurons in the hippocampus proper and in the dentate gyrus (excluding granule cells). In contrast, only a subset of CALB- and CALR-immunoreactive interneurons (24% and 23%, respectively) displayed hybridization signals for NGF. Small subsets of PARV- and CALR-positive cells expressed NT3 mRNA, but we did not find hippocampal interneurons expressing BDNF mRNA. These results show that NGF and NT3 genes are differentially regulated in distinct subsets of GABAergic cells, and these interneurons are a major source of NGF production in the hippocampus. We also addressed whether hippocampal interneurons expressing neurotrophins were targets of the GABAergic septohippocampal pathway. We developed a triple-labeling method that combines anterograde tracing of this pathway by means of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections, with in situ hybridization for the detection of neurotrophins, and immunocytochemistry for calcium-binding proteins. Virtually every PARV-positive neuron innervated by GABAergic septohippocampal baskets expressed NGF mRNA (86%), whereas 39-59% of CALR- and CALB-positive interneurons that were contacted by GABAergic septohippocampal axons showed NGF gene expression. A small subset of NT3 mRNA-expressing interneurons was also innervated by septohippocampal baskets. These findings show that the GABAergic septohippocampal pathway preferentially terminates on interneurons expressing NGF mRNA, suggesting that this neurotrophic factor might be involved in the specification of this connection and in its maintenance and normal function in the adult brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of somatostatin receptors sst1-5 was studied in human brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry using specific oligonucleotide probes. sst1 receptor mRNA was mainly found in the outer and intermediate layers of cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation (CA1, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex), hypothalamus, substantia nigra, medullary nuclei and dentate nucleus. sst2 transcripts were present in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampal formation (CA1, dentate gyrus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex), the granular layer of the cerebellum and pituitary. sst3 receptor mRNA was localized in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation (CA1, dentate gyrus), several medullary nuclei and the granule and possibly Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and at very low levels in the pituitary. sst4 receptor mRNA was absent in the cerebral cortex. Intermediate signals were observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and several medullary nuclei while an intense expression was found in the granule and Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum. sst5 transcripts were present in the pituitary and the granule layer of the cerebellum. The present results show that mRNAs of sst1-4 somatostatin receptors have distinct distribution patterns within the human brain, although there is overlap in several regions. sst5 receptor mRNA expression appears to be very low and restricted to the cerebellum and pituitary. The distribution pattern observed in the human brain was broadly similar to that reported previously in the rat brain. The high expression levels of at least two somatostatin receptor subtype mRNAs (sst2 and sst5) in the pituitary gland suggest that somatostatin may affect neuroendocrine functions via more than one receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The aim of this study was to determine the effect of repeated electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) on the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin (SS) mRNA in the rat brain. For that purpose, quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry and RNA blot analysis were used. In the hippocampal formation the prevalence of NPY mRNA positive neurons increased in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the CA3 while a decrease was seen in layers II-III of the entorhinal cortex. In contrast, SS mRNA was increased in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in most neurons of the outer parts of the layer III in the entorhinal cortex with cell bodies of perforant pathway projections to the hippocampal CA1 region. Both NPY and SS mRNA expressing neurons were increased in numerical density in the prefrontal cortex with similar amounts of mRNA in individual NPY positive neurons after the stimulations while SS mRNA levels decreased in hybridization positive neurons. In the striatum the only observed significant effect was an increased prevalence of NPY mRNA positive neurons in the caudal nucleus accumbens. Our results provide an outline of a complex functional anatomy of ECS in the rat brain. This type of investigations contributes to map the neuronal systems involved in the action of ECT used in the treatment of affective and schizophrenic disorders.',\n",

Injection of 50 microM NMDA in vivo on to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus results in a highly localized increase in Penk mRNA levels 24 h later, while vehicle has no effect. In contrast, there is a widespread induction of zif/268 mRNA throughout the dentate gyrus, after injection of either NMDA or vehicle. This suggests that zif/268 induction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is not sufficient to increase Penk gene expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"By using immunofluorescence methodology, extensive galanin (GAL) and GAL message-associated peptide (GMAP)-positive terminal networks were observed in the hippocampal formation. The majority of the GAL/GMAP fibers were dopamine beta-hydroxylase- (DBH) positive, that is, they were noradrenergic. This finding was established with GAL/GMAP-DBH double-staining and with 6-hydroxy-dopamine treatment, which totally abolished all fibers in which GAL/GMAP and DBH coexisted. Also, reserpine treatment caused a marked depletion of GAL. No evidence for GAL/GMAP coexistence with 5-hydroxytryptamine was obtained. In the ventral hippocampus, GAL/GMAP-, DBH-negative fibers were seen in the stratum oriens, the anterior stratum radiatum, along the granule cell layer and in the strata oriens and alveus. In the locus coeruleus (LC), around 80% of the GMAP-positive neurons contained neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), and about 40% of the NPY-positive neurons expressed GMAP. GAL-R1 receptor mRNA was expressed in Barrington's nucleus (close to the LC), but was not detected in the hippocampal formation/dorsal cortical areas. GAL-R2 receptor mRNA was found in the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus. The present results show that most, but not all, immunohistochemically detectable GAL/GMAP in the hippocampal formation/dorsal cortex is present in noradrenergic nerve terminals originating in the LC, which has a robust GAL/GMAP synthesis. The functional role of GAL may be related to noradrenaline, possibly by a presynaptic action. However, the presence of GAL in other systems and of GAL-R2 receptor mRNA in granule cells also indicates other targets.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Decreased expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 messenger RNA in select regions of Alzheimer brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"An antisense oligonucleotide probe was used to examine the expression of gene encoding the obligatory NMDAR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas (entorhinal and perirhinal cortices) of seven Alzheimer patients and in the same brain regions of seven control individuals. Both groups were matched according to age, sex, cause of death, post mortem delay, and tissue storage time. Densitometric analysis of in situ hybridization autoradiograms revealed a 34% (P<0.05) decrease in NMDAR1 messenger RNA levels in layer III of the entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer brains. Similar deficits. although statistically not significant, were observed in layers II and IV-VI of the entorhinal cortex, and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Reduced levels of NMDAR1 messenger RNA were also found in layers II-VI of the perirhinal cortex (41 53% decrease, P<0.02). There were no changes in NMDAR1 messenger RNA expression in the CA1, hilus, or subiculum. Both Alzheimer and control group show substantial intersubject variation in levels of NMDAR1 messenger RNA. The analysis of emulsion-dipped tissue revealed a trend toward a decrease in the number of silver grains overlying individual neurons in the CA1, entorhinal cortex, and granule cell layer of some Alzheimer patients. No significant relationship was detected between the levels of NMDAR1 messenger RNA and post mortem delay, tissue storage, age of the subjects, or mini mental state exam score either in control or Alzheimer individuals. In contrast, a strong inverse correlation between NMDAR1 expression and disease duration was found. These data suggest that reduction in expression of the NMDAR1 gene observed in certain regions of Alzheimer hippocampus and adjacent cortical regions is specific for the disease itself. We postulate that reduced transcript levels may reflect either regional cell loss or anomalies in glutamatergic input to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer's disease. When followed by changes at the receptor subunit protein level, altered expression of the NMDAR1 gene in Alzheimer brain may contribute, through the formation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors with different properties, to the previously reported modified N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ligand binding, abnormal vulnerability of select neuronal populations to excitotoxic insult, and may also be involved in learning and memory deficits.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), are upregulated during epileptic seizure activity, as visualized by in situ hybridization techniques. Neurotrophins might be protective against excitotoxic cell stress, and the upregulation during seizures might provide such cell protection. In this study, a high dose of pilocarpine (300 mg/kg) was used to induce long-lasting, limbic motor status epilepticus and a selective pattern of brain damage. The regulation of BDNF, trkB, and NGF mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after induction of limbic motor status epilepticus. BDNF immunoreactivity was examined with an anti-peptide antibody and the neuropathological process studied in parallel. BDNF mRNA increased in hippocampus, neocortex, piriform cortex, striatum, and thalamus with a maximum at 3-6 h. Hybridization levels increased earlier in the resistant granule and CA1 cells as compared to the vulnerable CA3 neurons. BDNF immunoreactivity was elevated in dentate gyrus at 3-6 h. trkB mRNA increased in the entire hippocampus. NGF mRNA in hippocampus appeared in dentate gyrus at 3-6 h and declined in hilar neurons at 6-24 h. Cell damage was found in the CA3 area, entire basal cortex, and layers II/III of neocortex. Endogenous neurotrophins are upregulated during status epilepticus caused by pilocarpine, which is related to the coupling between neuronal excitation and trophic factor expression. This upregulation of neurotrophic factors may serve endogenous protective effects; however, the excessive levels of neuronal hyperexcitation resulting from pilocarpine seizures lead to cell damage which cannot be prevented by endogenous neurotrophins.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We studied the time-dependent changes in synapsin I mRNA levels after hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Following LTP induction by stimulating the perforant path, synapsin I mRNA expression in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to stimulation increased significantly in a time-dependent manner. From 2 to 8 h after stimulation, the synapsin I mRNA levels in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus were significantly higher than those of controls subjected to a sham procedure. The synapsin I mRNA level (157.4+/-7.1% of the control level, mean+/-SEM) was at a maximum 8 h after stimulation. The synapsin I mRNA level of animals that received only test pulses did not increase significantly, compared with the control level. These results suggest that the increased level of synapsin I mRNA is related to persistent enhancement of synaptic activity within the neural networks in which dentate granule cells participate in LTP.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chronic lead exposure during brain development is known to affect cognitive and behavioral functions in children and animals. The lead exposure on pregnant rats was used as a model to examine the effects of lead on the long-term potentiation(LTP) in hippocampal dentate gyrus(DG) region in vivo and the expression of NMDAR-2A mRNA by in situ hybridization in the off-springs. Female rats were exposed to 0.5 g/L or 2 g/L lead acetate in drinking water since 10 days before mating to weaning. The filial rats of 70-90 days old with blood lead levels below 100 micrograms/L were prepared for recording their DG-evoked population spike(PS) in the hippocampal DG area in vivo. The results showed that the range of LTP were (136 +/- 31)% in low lead group, (145 +/- 30)% in high lead group, and (319 +/- 114)% in control group. The reduction of NMDAR-2A mRNA expression 34%-44% in the granule and pyramidal cell layers caused by lead were seen in 21 days old rats. It indicated that the cognitive deficits induced by low-level lead exposure in early stage of life may persist to adulthood, and the modified NMDAR gene expression may play a key role in the cognitive deficits associated with lead exposure during development.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Expression of connexin43 mRNA in adult rodent brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of connexin43 mRNA was detected in adult rat brains by in situ hybridization methods. Specific digoxigenin riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription of two PCR-amplified fragments of connexin43 cDNA which lack homology with any other published connexin. Following immunohistochemical detection, the digoxigenin cRNA was found to occur in various neuronal populations including Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, pyramidal cells of the neocortex and the hippocampal formation, as well as granule cells of the dentate gyrus and various neurons of diverse hindbrain nuclei. This ubiquituous expression of connexin43 mRNA in adult neurons, in particular in neocortical pyramidal cells, is surprising insofar as gap junction communication in adult bains has been considered to be confined to specific subpopulations of neurons revealing a high incidence of synchronized electrical activities in contrast to the postnatal brain where interneuronal coupling via gap junctions precedes the formation of chemical transmission. In addition, connexin43 is regarded as being preferentially expressed in astrocytes, although its presence in adult neurons has not definitely been excluded. We propose that adult neurons preserve their capability of expressing functional gap junctions more frequently than presently considered and that connexin43 is a most likely neuronal gap junction protein candidate.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential regulation of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and CNTF receptor alpha expression in astrocytes and neurons of the fascia dentata after entorhinal cortex lesion.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Neurotrophic factors have been implicated in reactive processes occurring in response to CNS lesions. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), in particular, has been shown to ameliorate axotomy-induced degeneration of CNS neurons and to be upregulated at wound sites in the brain. To investigate a potential role of CNTF in lesion-induced degeneration and reorganization, we have analyzed the expression of CNTF protein and CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR alpha) mRNA in the rat dentate gyrus after unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions (ECLs), using immunocytochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization, respectively. In sham-operated as in normal animals, CNTF protein was not detectable by immunocytochemistry. Starting at 3 d after ECL, upregulation of CNTF expression was observed in the ipsilateral outer molecular layer (OML). Expression was maximal at around day 7, and at this stage immunoreactivity could be specifically localized to astrocytes in the ipsilateral OML. By day 14 postlesion, CNTF immunoreactivity had returned to control levels. CNTFR alpha mRNA was restricted to neurons of the granule cell layer in controls. Three days postlesion, prominent CNTFR alpha expression was observed in the deafferented OML. A similar but less prominent response was noticed in the contralateral OML. After 10 d, CNTFR alpha expression had returned to control levels. Double labeling for CNTFR alpha mRNA and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed that upregulation of CNTFR alpha occurred in reactive, GFAP-immunopositive astrocytes of the OML. A substantial reduction of CNTFR alpha expression in the deafferented granule cells was transiently observed at 7 and 10 d postlesion. Our results suggest a paracrine or autocrine function of CNTF in the regulation of astrocytic and neuronal responses after brain injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in the hippocampal formation is thought to play an important role in learning and memory. This limbic structure contains one of the highest concentrations of NMDA binding sites in the brain. The hippocampal formation also contains high levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA and protein in the central nervous system. The expression of this neurotrophic factor may be regulated by events involving glutamatergic neurotransmission. In the present study, in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to determine the effects of NMDA receptor activation on NGF mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation. The gene encoding this neurotrophic factor was increased exclusively in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal structure that receives extensive glutamatergic innervation from the entorhinal cortex. It is suggested that one consequence of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the dentate gyrus is the activation of NGF mRNA. The increased expression of this neurotrophic factor may ultimately influence the function of NGF-responsive cells innervating the hippocampal formation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Low voltage-activated (T-type) calcium currents are observed in many central and peripheral neurons and display distinct physiological and functional properties. Using in situ hybridization, we have localized central and peripheral nervous system expression of three transcripts (alpha1G, alpha1H, and alpha1I) of the T-type calcium channel family (CaVT). Each mRNA demonstrated a unique distribution, and expression of the three genes was largely complementary. We found high levels of expression of these transcripts in regions associated with prominent T-type currents, including inferior olivary and thalamic relay neurons (which expressed alpha1G), sensory ganglia, pituitary, and dentate gyrus granule neurons (alpha1H), and thalamic reticular neurons (alpha1I and alpha1H). Other regions of high expression included the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the claustrum (alpha1G), the olfactory tubercles (alpha1H and alpha1I), and the subthalamic nucleus (alpha1I and alpha1G). Some neurons expressed high levels of all three genes, including hippocampal pyramidal neurons and olfactory granule cells. Many brain regions showed a predominance of labeling for alpha1G, including the amygdala, cerebral cortex, rostral hypothalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Exceptions included the basal ganglia, which showed more prominent labeling for alpha1H and alpha1I, and the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus, and the caudal hypothalamus, which showed more even levels of all three transcripts. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differential gene expression underlies pharmacological and physiological heterogeneity observed in neuronal T-type calcium currents, and they provide a molecular basis for the study of T-type channels in particular neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Tyrosine protein kinases trkA, trkB and trkC are signal transduction receptors for a family of neurotrophic factors known as the neurotrophins. Here we report on changes in the expression of messenger RNAs for trkA, trkB and trkC in the brain following an injury caused by insertion of a 30-gauge needle into adult rat hippocampus or neocortex. Quantitative in situ hybridization revealed no change in the level of trkA messenger RNAs in any brain region following this insult. In contrast, increased levels of trkB messenger RNA compared to untreated animals were seen in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to the injury already 30 min after the injury. The increase reached maximal levels (four-fold) between 2 and 4 h, but returned to control levels 8 h after the injury. No change was seen in the contralateral dentate gyrus. The levels of trkC messenger RNA increased in the same brain regions as trkB messenger RNA, though with a delayed response, reaching a maximal increase of 3.3-fold 4 h after the injury. As for trkB messenger RNA, the level of trkC messenger RNA then tapered off and reached control levels 8 h after the injury. However, 4 h after the injury, a 1.7-fold increase of trkB and trkC messenger RNAs were seen in the ipsilateral piriform cortex. The increases of trkB and trkC messenger RNAs were confirmed using a nuclease protection assay. Increases of both trkB and trkC messenger RNAs were also seen in the piriform cortex, but not in the hippocampus, following needle insertion into the neocortex. Pretreatment of the animals with the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine completely prevented the increases of trkB and trkC messenger RNAs, suggesting that the brain injury caused a release of glutamate with subsequent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In contrast, the anticonvulsive drug diazepam, the muscarinic antagonist atropine and the calcium-channel antagonist nimodipine had no effect on the increases of trkB and trkC messenger RNAs. Combined with previous data on the expression of neurotrophin messenger RNAs following similar injuries, our results support the hypothesis that increased levels of neurotrophins and their receptors could protect against neuronal damage following a brain insult.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A regional Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the highest levels of NF-L mRNA in the adult mouse brain are present in brain stem followed by mid-brain, with lower levels found in neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. The study was extended to the cellular level over course of postnatal development using in situ hybridization. This developmental analysis revealed that the expression of NF-L mRNA closely follows the differentiation pattern of many large neurons during postnatal neurogenesis. Neurons which differentiate early such as Purkinje, mitral, pyramidal, and large neurons of brain stem and thalamic nuclei, expressed high levels of NF-L mRNA at postnatal day 1. Early expression of NF-L mRNA may be required for the maintenance of the extensive neurofilament protein networks that are detected within the axons of larger neurons. Smaller neurons which differentiate later, such as dentate gyrus granule cells, small pyramidal and granule cells of the neocortex, and granule cells of the cerebellum, exhibit a delayed expression of NF-L mRNA.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution of the mRNAs encoding the gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits of the GABAA receptor in the rat brain has been revealed by in situ hybridization, northern blot and dot blot analysis using specific antisense oligonucleotides. In addition, the quantitative distribution of the gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunit peptides participating in the fully assembled GABAA receptors/benzodiazepine receptors has been mapped by immunoprecipitation with specific anti-gamma 2S and anti-gamma 2L antibodies. Several neuronal types and brain regions are enriched in gamma 2L such as neurons of the layer II of striate cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as the inferior colliculus, superior colliculus, deep cerebellar nuclei, medulla and pons. Other neuronal types and regions are enriched in gamma 2S such as the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal neurons of the pyriform cortex, layer VI of the neocortex, granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Other cortical areas and cerebellar granule cells express both gamma 2S and gamma 2L in comparable amounts. There is a good correlation between the relative expression of gamma 2S and gamma 2L mRNAs and the relative presence of these protein subunits in fully assembled and mature receptors in the studied brain regions.

Areas where the majority of neurons expressed a high density of mRNA included the medial habenula; the septohippocampal, periventricular, suprachiasmatic, and supraoptic nuclei; Purkinje cells in the cerebellum; and pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, respectively. Also, brainstem nuclei containing monoaminergic neurons and neurons in the thalamic motor nuclei contained relatively high levels of expression. mRNA was low or absent in neuronal populations in regions with well-developed cytoarchitecture, such as the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens of the hippocampus, the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum, and the molecular layer of the cortex. Low expression was observed also in many extrapyramidal nuclei, such as the globus and ventral pallidum and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata.

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA in normal rat forebrain, and the influence of recurrent seizure activity on the expression of this mRNA, was evaluated using in situ hybridization and S1 nuclease protection techniques. In the untreated adult rat, hybridization of 35S-labeled bFGF cRNA densely labeled neurons in a few discrete areas including the tenia tecta, indusium gresium, and hippocampal stratum pyramidale of regions CA2 and rostromedial CA1. Neurons in the prosubiculum and rostromedial dentate gyrus stratum granulosum were lightly labeled. In addition, a diffuse distribution of autoradiographic labeling in areas such as the hippocampal molecular layers, olfactory cortical layer I, and the olfactory nerve layer was suggestive of localization in glial cells. Platinum wire hilar lesions, which did not induce seizures, increased cRNA hybridization in glial cells in primary and secondary areas of degeneration in the ipsilateral hemisphere only; hybridization was not noticeably increased in neurons in these lesion-control rats. Focal stainless-steel wire hilar lesions, which caused recurrent seizures 2-10 h postlesion, induced bilaterally distributed increases in cRNA hybridization in hippocampus, neocortex, olfactory cortex, amygdala, and septum. These seizure-dependent increases in hybridization were evident 6 h postlesion, were maximal from 12 to 24 h postlesion, and declined to near control levels by 4 days. In most regions the elevated hybridization appeared to be associated primarily with astroglia but in experimental seizure rats sacrificed 12 and 24 h postlesion hybridization was also markedly increased in the dentate gyrus granule cells and olfactory cortical neurons. These results demonstrate that recurrent seizures increase bFGF mRNA expression by both forebrain neurons and glia and implicate bFGF in the coordination of other changes in the biosynthetic activities of forebrain neurons that occur after seizures.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of members of the Jun family of transcription factors was examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, in situ hybridization and Northern blotting in the developing and adult rat brain following colchicine administration. Apoptotic cells, as revealed by their typical morphology and positive staining with the method of in situ end-labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation, were restricted to granule cells of the dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb, and a few cells in the upper layers of the entorhinal cortex in adult rats, whereas widespread apoptosis occurred in developing rats after colchicine administration. No modifications in the expression of Jun D and Jun B, except for a generalized and moderate Jun B expression in glial cells, were observed in colchicine-treated rats. Generalized and strong c-jun mRNA induction and c-Jun/AP-1 (Ab-1) protein expression was observed in the cerebral neocortex, entorhinal and piriform cortices, CAI and CA3 areas of the hippocampus and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in adult treated rats, thus indicating a generalized c-Jun response to colchicine administration. In contrast, c-Jun/AP-1 (N) and c-Jun/AP-1 (Ab-2) immunoreactivity was restricted to apoptotic cells in colchicine-treated adult and developing brains. Western blots of hippocampal homogenates and total brain homogenates in adult and developing rats, respectively, demonstrated a band of 39 kDa for the c-Jun/AP-1 (Ab-1) antibody in control animals, the intensity of which increased in colchicine-treated rats. However, a band of 37 kDa, the intensity of which also increased following colchicine administration, was observed for the c-Jun/AP- (N) and c-Jun/AP- (Ab-2) antibodies. Selective c-Jun/AP-1 (N) and c-Jun/AP-1 (Ab-2) expression was also observed in apoptotic cells of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma line after the addition of colchicine to the culture medium. Taken together, the present in vivo and in vitro results indicate a generalized c-Jun response to colchicine in sensitive cells, whereas the antibodies c-Jun/AP- (N) and c-Jun/AP-1 (Ab-2) recognize vulnerable cells dying via apoptosis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) is expressed normally at high levels in dentate gyrus granule cells in hippocampus and in neurons in entorhinal and neocortex. In the present study, ribonuclease protection and in situ hybridization analyses were used to examine preproDYN mRNA expression in hippocampus and neocortex following recurrent limbic seizure induced by a unilateral electrolytic lesion of the dentate gyrus hilus. In this paradigm, electrographic seizures within hippocampus recur intermittently from 1.6 to 12 h following the hilus lesion (HL). Solution hybridization-ribonuclease protection analysis of preproDYN mRNA levels in hippocampal dentate gyrus/CA1 samples from rats sacrificed 6 and 12 h following HL revealed an approximate 6-fold increase above control values at both times. PreproDYN mRNA levels returned toward control values by 24 h post-HL, were suppressed up to 10-fold below control values at 48 and 96 h post-HL, and then returned to control levels by 10 days post-HL. In situ hybridization analyses confirmed the biphasic nature of seizure-induced changes in preproDYN expression specifically within dentate gyrus granule cells. Additionally, these latter studies demonstrated that seizures induce expression of preproDYN mRNA in a small population of neurons within stratum pyramidale CAL Transient increases in preproDYN mRNA were also detected in subiculum and entorhinal cortex. However, in neocortex hybridization of preproDYN mRNA remained constant through 96 h post-HL. These findings of biphasic seizure-induced alterations in preproDYN mRNA expression can be contrasted with previously described changes in gene expression following limbic seizure activity and suggest that different cellular mechanisms regulate expression of colocalized hippocampal neuropeptides such as dynorphin, Metenkephalin, and neuropeptide Y.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Focal brain injury is known to markedly induce the fos and jun families of immediate early genes (IEGs). This study employed in situ hybridization to examine the effects of focal brain injury, produced by the intracerebral injection of saline or ibotenic acid on the expression of IEGs encoding zinc finger transcription factors. Thirty minutes after the injections, NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C, and egr-3 mRNAs were induced in dentate gyrus, hippocampal pyramidal cells, cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen and piriform cortex of the injured hemisphere. Nurr1 was induced in hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. After three hours the induction of NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and Nurr1 persisted in all brain regions except for the dentate granule cells. By six hours after injection mRNAs for most of the zinc finger genes had returned to control levels. However, the expression of egr-3 3 and 6 h after the injection was identical to that observed at 30 min after the injection and it was the only gene the expression of which persisted 6 h following the injections. Twenty-four hours after the injection, the expression of all five IEGs returned to control levels. In general, no gross differences in the IEG induction were observed between the animals injected with saline and ibotenic acid. Since these zinc finger genes were expressed in the same regions where fos and jun family members are induced by similar types of brain injury, it is suggested that these transcription factors may act in concert with Fos/Jun family members.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Acidic calponin cloned from neural cells is differentially expressed during rat brain development.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Calponin is an actin-, tropomyosin- and Ca2+ calmodulin-binding protein that inhibits in vitro the actomyosin MgATPase. Basic and acidic variants of calponin have been described to date. Although the cerebral expression of calponin remained controversial for some time, transcripts encoding acidic calponin in the adult rat brain and in cultured cerebellar cells have been reported. In the present work, we report the expression of acidic calponin mRNAs and the isolation of cDNAs encoding the full-length acidic calponin in cultured neuronal and glial cells and in adult rat brain. Sequence analysis reveals that acidic calponin in the brain is identical to that previously described in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle. In situ hybridization shows that calponin is highly expressed during ontogenesis in granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, in all layers of the olfactory bulb and in cerebellar granule neurons of the external and internal layers. In the adult rat brain, calponin expression decreased in these fields, but increased in choroid plexus cells. Bergmann glial cells were also labelled by a calponin probe. The reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction confirms that calponin mRNA levels are highest in the early stages of hippocampal development and that expression levels are low in adult hippocampi. The developmental expression pattern of brain acidic calponin suggests that calponin could be involved in contractile activity associated with neural cell proliferation or neuronal migration.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Following stimulation by the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family in the cytoplasm, the Smad family is phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus and activates several gene transcriptions. In this study, the mouse Smad3 cDNA including the open reading frame (ORF) was cloned from the mouse brain using a RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) technique, and its expression pattern was analyzed in mouse tissue using northern blot. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequences of mouse Smad3 showed a high homology with human Smad3 (99.3%) and mouse Smad2 (85.4%). It revealed that this protein may be highly conserved in different species of mammals. Northern blot analyses revealed that Smad3 was highly expressed in the brain and ovary, and that the size of major transcript was about 5.7 kb. In situ hybridization analyses revealed the high expression of Smad3 was detected in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, the granular cells of the cerebral cortex and the granulosa cells of the ovary.

       "  'Abstract': 'CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) is a transcriptional regulator of the basic leucine zipper family. By in situ hybridization analysis, we found that C/EBPbeta is widely expressed in the CNS of adult mice, including cells of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus and cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells. Expression of C/EBPbeta had also been reported in the PC12 cell line, which undergoes differentiation to neuron-like cells in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). We show that C/EBPbeta mRNA expression increases while protein levels decrease during differentiation of PC12 cells. In transactivation assays, C/EBPbeta activity was stimulated by NGF receptor signaling. Mutations of a phosphorylation site for mitogen-activated protein kinase in C/EBPbeta affected its capacity to transactivate in a promoter-specific manner. Our data identify the C/EBPbeta protein and gene as direct downstream targets of the NGF receptor and suggest a role for C/EBPbeta in neurotrophin signaling in the brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that following the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats, specific increases in the expression of the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and mGluR1c, a short splice variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptors that are linked intracellularly to phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC), were seen in the postsynaptic dentate granule cells. There were no changes in the expression of NR2A; NR2C and NR2D NMDA receptor subunits; or mGluR1a, mGluR1b, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b PLC-associated metabotropic receptors. The elevations in NR2B and mGluR1c mRNA were delayed, occurring days after LTP induction. NR2B expression was enhanced significantly by 48 hr after LTP but was starting to decrease toward basal levels by 96 hr. The transient increase in the expression of NR2B mirrored the increase in the expression of PKC-sensitive isoforms of the NR1 subunits of the NMDA receptor we observed previously (Thomas et al. 1994a). The increase in mGluR1c expression was more persistent, showing a significant increase 96 hr after LTP. This study demonstrates that not only are there changes in the expression of individual glutamate receptor subunits but the increases in their expression occur days after the induction of LTP and may reflect so-called late-onset genes that may be important for the maintenance of LTP.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The beta transforming growth factors (TGF-beta) are suggested to regulate developmental processes since they are distinctly expressed during embryogenesis and exert pleiotropic effects on cell growth and differentiation, In the present study the expression of TGF-beta isoforms was investigated in the postnatal and adult mouse brain. As shown by in situ hybridization, TGF-beta 2 was expressed in the choroid plexus, hippocampus, dentate gyrus and cerebellar Purkinje neurons, both postnatally and in adults. Furthermore, TGF-beta 2 expression was observed postnatally in immature cerebellar neurons of both the external and internal granule cell layers. In the external granule cell layer, the frequency of TGF-beta2 transcripts increased until postnatal day 10 and declined thereafter. In contrast to TGF-beta 2, no TGF-beta 1 mRNA was detected in cerebellar granule cells. TGF-beta 3 expression was widely distributed in postnatal brains although at very low levels. The significance of TGF-beta 2 production by cerebellar granule cells was further investigated using cultures of small cerebellar neurons. In these cultures reverse polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed expression of TGF-beta 2 but low or almost undetectable levels of TGF-beta 1 or -beta 3 mRNAs. Likewise, only TGF-beta 2 protein in its latent form was identified in the culture supernatant; the release of TGF-beta 2 was maximal during the second day in vitro. Furthermore, TGF-beta was found to inhibit the proliferation of cultured small cerebellar neurons. Taken together, these data suggest that TGF-beta 2 is involved in the regulation of postnatal development of the cerebellum.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Changes in gene expression of AMPA-selective glutamate receptor subunits induced by status epilepticus in rat brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In the present investigation we address the question of whether one of the responses to increased neuronal activity is a modification of the expression of the different subunits of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-selective glutamate receptors (GluR-1, GluR-2, GluR-3). Thus, we used two different models of generalized status epilepticus, as widespread elevated neuronal activity, to study in vivo responses of the AMPA receptor mRNA expression in rat forebrain. By Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization, we show that one of the delayed responses to LiCl/pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus is a dramatic change in the mRNA level of some subunits of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors. These effects, which appear between 6 and 12 h after the drug treatment, are subunit and brain region specific. The most striking example of differential expression of the three examined GluR mRNAs can be observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In this specific brain subregion an increase of GluR-3 mRNA level is induced 12 h after LiCl/pilocarpine treatment, while a clear decrease in GluR-1 mRNA level and no significant change in GluR-2 mRNA level can be observed in the same area under these experimental conditions. Both the GluR-1 decrease and the GluR-3 increase are transient effects and a return to basal level can be observed after 48-72 h. In the CA1 layer of the hippocampus, a parallel decrease of both GluR-1 and GluR-3 expression is found 12-24 h after drug treatment, followed by a recovery of the expression to control values at 48 h. In kainate-induced epilepsy we could reproduce the late increase (12-24 h) in GluR-3 mRNA in the dentate gyrus; however, under this experimental condition, no clear decrease of GluR-1 expression can be observed in this area. A general decrease in mRNA level for the AMPA receptor subunits (GluR-1-3) in the hippocampal layers, in particular in CA3 and CA4 subfields, was also observed. In conclusion the results reported in the present paper reveal a specific regulation of GluR gene expression in the granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and stimulate further investigation on the functional role of the GluR-3 subunit in the receptor-channel complex.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Intraperitoneal or intrahippocampal injections of kainate induce both hippocampal cell death and axonal remodeling of the dentate gyrus granular neurons. We report here that injection of kainate into the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice may also trigger a conspicuous and long-lasting global trophic response of granule cells. Morphological changes include somatic and dendritic growth and increased nuclear volume with ultrastructural features characteristic of neuronal development. The trophic response is correlated with a specific overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor that is maintained for at least six months. This shows that plasticity in adult neurons can, in addition to axonal remodeling, extend to generalized cell growth. Our results further suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor could be involved in the activation and/or maintenance of this phenomenon.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We developed a selective antibody to a synthetic peptide corresponding to an N-terminal sequence of the PCTAIRE-1 protein. In rodent brain extracts it recognized only the protein doublet characteristic of PCTAIRE-1, and this signal is completely abolished by preincubation of the antibody with the immunopeptide. Immunolabeling experiments done with this PCTAIRE-1-specific antibody reveal that the protein is widely distributed in the rodent brain as are the mRNAs visualized using an antisense riboprobe corresponding to the entire PCTAIRE-1 open reading frame. Two types of PCTAIRE-1 protein localizations were observed: first a diffuse labeling of almost all brain regions, particularly intense in the molecular layer of the cerebellum and the mossy fiber region of the hippocampus, and second a spot-like localization in the nuclei of large neurons such as cerebellar Purkinje cells and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Colocalization with the B23 protein allows one to identify these compartments as nucleoli. Our results suggest a nucleolar function of PCTAIRE-1 in large neurons and a role in regions containing important granule cell projections.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The functions of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family members in the adult brain are not known. This study investigated the changes in the expression of members of the EGF family following global ischemia employing in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques to elucidate their roles in pathological conditions. EGF mRNA was not detected in either the control or the postischemic rat brain. Although transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) mRNA was widely expressed in the normal brain, its expression did not change appreciably following ischemia. By contrast, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) mRNA expression was rapidly increased in the CA3 sector and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, and cerebellar granule and Purkinje cell layers. EGF receptor mRNA, which was widely expressed, also showed an increase in the CA3 sector and dentate gyrus. Conversely, HB-EGF mRNA did not show any increase prior to ischemic neuronal injury in the CA1 sector, the region most vulnerable to ischemia. Immunohistochemical detection of HB-EGF in the postischemic brain suggested a slight increase of immunostaining in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cortex. These findings showed that the gene encoding HB-EGF is stress-inducible, indicating the likelihood that HB-EGF is a neuroprotective factor in cerebral ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is closely related to two known neurotrophic agents, NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and acts upon overlapping, yet distinct, populations of peripheral ganglia. NT-3 mRNA expression in the adult rat brain is largely confined to the hippocampus. In this study, we have used in situ hybridization to examine expression of this novel neurotrophic factor during postnatal development. The striking observation was made that NT-3 mRNA was transiently expressed at high levels in the cingulate cortex during the first 2 weeks of age. In the hippocampus, the adult pattern of expression, in the CA2, medial CA1, and granule layer of the dentate gyrus, was detected at all ages examined. However, there were two major differences in NT-3 mRNA expression in the developing hippocampus: Labeled cells were detected in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus at postnatal day 1 (P1) and 1 week that were absent by 2 weeks of age. Further, the caudal hippocampus, which has a lower intensity of labeling than the rostral region in the adult, was devoid of NT-3-expressing cells in the P1 and 1-week-old rat brain. These data indicate a substantial plasticity in NT-3 mRNA expression and suggest that the spectrum of neurons supported by NT-3 during development is partially different from that in the mature rat brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mRNA levels of secretogranin II, chromogranin B, and VGF were compared in brains of control and AF64A-treated rats. This toxin induces specific lesions of the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway. As a consequence of this treatment, the chromogranin B message was elevated in the dentate gyrus granule cells of the hippocampus. In the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, a concomitant elevation of the messages of secretogranin II and corticotropin-releasing factor occurred in the parvocellular neurons, and an increase of those of secretogranin II and VGF occurred in a subgroup of magnocellular neurons. Further increases for secretogranin II were seen in the amygdaloid nuclei and the reticular thalamic nuclei and increases for chromogranin B in the temporal cortex, substantia nigra compacta, and ventral tegmental area. These results indicate that the toxin-induced lesion of the cholinergic pathway innervating the hippocampus apparently leads to the stimulation of several defined groups of neurons that react with an increase in the mRNA levels of their secretory peptides. We suggest that changes in mRNA expression of these peptides are useful parameters for defining neurons under chronic stimulation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The distribution of PACAP-typeI-receptor (PACAP-I-R) mRNA and protein was studied in mouse using probes and a newly developed antiserum recognizing all known splice variants. RNase protection assays revealed highest expression levels of PACAP-I-R mRNA in brain, in particular the hypothalamus and hippocampus. At the cellular level, in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated widespread distribution of PACAP-I-R mRNA in neurons throughout the brain, while glial cells did not express the gene. Highest expression levels of PACAP-I-R mRNA were observed in three regions: the limbic system, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem. In accordance with data obtained from in situ hybridization analysis, immunohistochemistry showed widespread distribution of PACAP-I-R like immunoreactivity in the neuropil. Rather strong immunoreactivity was found in cerebellar and hippocampal mossy fibres where double immunolabelling revealed the presynaptic localization of the receptor protein. At the ultrastructural level, PACAP-I-R like immunoreactivity was observed around synaptic vesicles and close to the presynaptic grid in hippocampal mossy fibre terminals. This finding is in contradiction to the described postsynaptic localization of the PACAP-I-R in dendritic processes of hippocampal granule cells in rat. Due to their presynaptic induction, mossy fibre LTPs are distinctly different from LTPs in all other hippocampal regions. Therefore, the presynaptic localization of the PACAP-I-R in mossy fibre terminals may implicate this gene in influencing the synaptic strength of the mossy fibre pathway and hence memory consolidation.',\n",

Both neuronal populations express N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and receive putative glutamatergic afferents originating in the entorhinal cortex and projecting via the perforant path. We report in this study that intra-hippocampal or intraventricular injections of NMDA increase NGF mRNA levels in dentate gyrus granule cells as determined using in situ hybridization histochemistry and a solution hybridization assay. NGF mRNA induction is detected within 2 h following NMDA treatment and returns to control levels within 24 h. This NMDA effect is dose-dependent and blocked by pretreatment with 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, a competitive NMDA antagonist. Finally, the induction of NGF mRNA is observed in the absence of detectable neurotoxicity or seizure activity. We postulate that normal physiological events associated with the activation of hippocampal NMDA receptors may regulate mRNA expression of this neurotrophic factor.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Detailed mapping of the histamine H2 receptor and its gene transcripts in guinea-pig brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Autoradiographic studies of the distribution of the histamine H2 receptor and its messenger RNAs were performed on serial frontal and a few sagittal sections of guinea-pig brain using [(125)I]iodoaminopotentidine for radioligand binding and a 33P-labelled complementary RNA probe for in situ hybridization, respectively. Both probes were validated by assessing non-specific labelling using non-radioactive competing H2 receptor ligands and a sense probe for binding sites and gene transcripts, respectively. In some areas, e.g., cerebral cortex, hippocampal complex or cerebellum, such studies were completed by identification of neurons expressing the H2 receptor messenger RNAs on emulsion-dipped sections. Nissl-stained sections from comparable levels were used to localize brain structures. In many brain areas, the distribution of the H2 receptor and its messenger RNAs appeared to parallel that known for histaminergic axons. For instance. high levels of both H2 receptor markers were detected in striatal and limbic areas known to receive abundant histaminergic projections. In contrast, in septum, hypothalamic, pontine and several thalamic nuclei, a comparatively low density of both H2 receptor markers was detected, suggesting that histamine actions in these areas are mediated by H1 and/or H3 receptors. Generally, the distribution of H2 receptor messenger RNA correlates well with that of [(125)I]iodoaminopotentidine binding sites, although some differences were observed. In a few regions (e.g., substantia nigra, locus coeruleus) high or moderate densities of binding sites were accompanied by a much more restricted expression of H2 receptor transcripts. Conversely, the mammillary region and the pontine nucleus exhibited higher levels of hybridization than of binding sites. In hippocampus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex there was a selective localization of the H2 receptor messenger RNA in the granule cells of dentate gyrus, pyramidal cells of the Ammon's horn and cerebral cortex, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum, whereas [(125)I]iodoaminopotentidine binding sites were located in layers where the dendritic trees of these messenger RNA-expressing neurons extend. The same discrepancy between messenger RNAs and binding sites suggests that striatonigral endings are endowed with the H2 receptor. The histamine H1 and H2 receptors both appear to be present in several brain areas, in some cases in a way suggesting their potential co-expression by the same neuronal populations, e.g., in granule and pyramidal cells in the hippocampal formation. This co-expression accounts for synergic responses, e.g., on cAMP generation, previously observed upon co-stimulation of both receptor subtypes. The widespread distribution of the H2 receptor, namely in thalamic nuclei or in telencephalic areas such as most layers of the cerebral cortex, together with its excitatory role previously established in electrophysiological studies, support its alleged function in mediating the histamine-driven control of arousal mechanisms. In addition, the detection of H2 receptor expression in brainstem areas from which other monoaminergic pathways involved in the control of states of sleep and wakefulness emanate, e.g., several raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus or substantia innominata, suggests possible interrelationships between all of these systems with highly divergent projections to the thalamus and telencephalon. The present mapping of the H2 receptor and its gene transcripts should facilitate neurochemical, neurophysiological and behavioural studies aimed at clarifying the role of histaminergic systems in brain.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization was used to study expression of mRNAs for members of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family in the rat brain after 2 and 10 min of forebrain ischemia and 1 and 30 min of insulin-induced hypoglycemic coma. Two hours after the ischemic insults, the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA was markedly increased in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and at 24 h it was still significantly elevated. NGF mRNA showed a pronounced increase 4 h after 2 min of ischemia but had returned to a control level at 24 h. Both 2 and 10 min of ischemia caused a clear reduction of the level of mRNA for neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) in the dentate granule cells and in regions CA2 and medial CA1 of the hippocampus 2 and 4 h after the insults. The increase of BDNF mRNA could be partially blocked by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist NBQX but was not influenced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801. Both NBQX and MK-801 attenuated the decrease of NT-3 mRNA after ischemia. One and 30 min of hypoglycemic coma also induced marked increases in BDNF and NGF mRNA in dentate granule cells with maximal levels at 2 h. If the changes of mRNA expression lead to alterations in the relative availability of neurotrophic factors, this could influence functional outcome and neuronal necrosis following ischemic and hypoglycemic insults.',\n",

By in situ hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides, we here demonstrate for the first time its neuronal localization in the rat brain. Hybridization signal was detected in all the olfactory areas; in pyramidal and non pyramidal-shaped neurons in the different layers of the cerebral cortex, especially the superficial ones; in the pyramidal cells of the different sectors of the Ammon's horn and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; in the subiculum; in the medium-sized and large neurons of the different quadrants of the caudate-putamen and accumbens and in the cerebellar Purkinje cells. Hybridization was also observed to a lesser extent in the majority of the neurons in the basal areas of the forebrain, including septum, nucleus of the diagonal band and amygdala; in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta, ventral tegmental area; in the subthalamic nucleus; in the thalamus; in the hypothalamus; in the brainstem and in the upper cervical spinal cord. In addition to its neuronal localization, calcyphosine mRNA was also found in ependymal cells. The non-detection of positive cells in the white matter was not in favor of prominent glial localization, although it does not exclude it.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The requirement of protein and messenger RNA synthesis for long-term memory suggests that neural activity induced by learning initiates a cascade of gene expression. Here we use differential screening to identify five immediate-early genes induced by neuronal activity. One of these is tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA), an extracellular serine protease, which is induced with different spatial patterns in the brain by three activity-dependent events: (1) convulsive seizure increases expression of tPA in the whole brain; (2) stimulation of the perforant path produces an epileptiform after-discharge that ultimately leads to kindling increases the levels of tPA throughout the hippocampus bilaterally; and (3) brief high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path that produces long-term potentiation (LTP) causes an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated increase in the levels of tPA mRNA which is restricted to the granule cells of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. As release of tPA is correlated with morphological differentiation, the increased expression of tPA may play a role in the structural changes that accompany activity-dependent plasticity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"A complementary DNA (cDNA) library was constructed with a plasmid vector from cerebral cortices of gerbils at 8 h of reperfusion after 10 min of bilateral common carotid ligation. After the 3rd screening of this cDNA library with a human genomic DNA probe for HSP70 (pH2.3), 4 cDNA clones were isolated (named pGA3' pGB1' pGD3 and pGE4' respectively). Southern and Northern blot analysis, and partial nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that pGA3 and pGE4 were the HSP70 cDNA clones, and that pGB1 and pGD3 were the HSC70 cDNA clones, which selectively recognized HSP70 or HSC70 mRNA, respectively. HSP70 mRNA is present in a very small amount in normal controls, and is greatly induced after the transient ischaemia. HSC70 mRNA is constitutively expressed in a normal gerbil brain, but is still inducible. In situ hybridization study demonstrated that the HSP70 mRNA was present in a very small amount in the hippocampal pyramidal and dentate granule cells in the sham control, and that the mRNA was greatly induced in the cells of hippocampus, dentate gyrus, medial habenula, ventral thalamic nuclei, caudate putamen, ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei, amygdaloid nuclei and cerebral cortex after 8 h of reperfusion. HSC70 mRNA was present in almost the same areas of sham control, and was slightly induced after 8 h of reperfusion. Our results indicate that HSP70 and HSC70 cDNA clones were first isolated from post-ischaemic gerbil brain, and selectively recognize HSP70 or HSC70 mRNA, respectively. A regional difference in the induction of the HSP70 and HSC70 mRNA in post-ischaemic gerbil brain was observed by in situ hybridization.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Food restriction increases life-span in rodents. With regard to the central nervous system, underfeeding has been shown to have beneficial effects on synaptic transmission in old rats. However, the molecular events underlying functional changes in the brains of food-restricted rats are largely unknown. In the present study the levels of fibronectin mRNA containing the alternatively spliced segment V (FN-V+) as well as the levels of FN mRNA containing the alternatively spliced segment EIIIB (FN-EIIIB+), were examined by RNA gel blot hybridization in the brains of 3-day-old, 24-day-old, 10-month-old, 18-month-old, 30-month-old ad libitum (AL) fed, 30-month-old food-restricted (FR), and 35-37-month-old, FR rats. The hybridization signal for the FN-EIIIB+ mRNA was relatively abundant at early postnatal stages but very few transcripts were detected in the brains of adult, AL rats. The transcripts coding for FN-V+ mRNA were moderately expressed in the brains of 3-day-old, 24-day-old, 10-month-old, and 18-month-old rats. However, the FN-V+ mRNA signal was then prominently increased (approx. 3-fold) in the brains of the 30-month-old, AL rats vs. 10-month-old, AL rats, and further increased (approx. 2-fold) in the brains of 30-month-old, FR, as compared to 30-month-old, AL rats. However, the levels of FN-V+ mRNA were slightly decreased in the brains of very old (35-37-month) FR rats vs. 30-month-old FR rats. The distribution of fibronectin messenger RNA and protein was also investigated by non-radioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The most prominent expression of FN-V+ messenger RNA was seen in neurons of the hippocampus, including the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and in layers III and V of the cortex of 30-month-old, FR rats. FN immunostaining closely paralleled the distribution of FN mRNA and was confined to the neuronal cell periphery. The upregulation of fibronectin gene expression upon exposure to glucocorticoids is well documented. Prolonged food restriction, acting as a stress factor, combined with decreased plasticity of glucocorticoid regulatory responses in the aged rats could cause an increase in the levels of FN mRNA and protein in the brains of old, FR rats. Since FN has been shown to provide an adhesive substrate for extending neurites, we conclude that food restriction may potentiate synaptic plasticity, via glucocorticoid receptor binding elements of the FN gene, in the brains of old rats.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have found a regional distribution of IL 1 beta mRNA and IL 1 activity in the normal adult rat brain, which reveals at least partially a colocalization with nerve growth factor (NGF). The predominantly neuronal signal patterns were found over the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the granule cells of the cerebellum, the granule and periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb, and over dispersed cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus and of the frontal cortex. In these areas also the highest levels of IL 1 activity were observed. In the striatum and septum much lower levels of IL 1 beta mRNA and IL 1 activity (shown for the striatum), most likely synthesized by glial cells, could be determined. IL 1 beta-expressing cells were mainly found in brain regions that also synthesize NGF mRNA as shown by in situ hybridization. NGF mRNA could be demonstrated over pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb and over prefrontal cortex neurons. These data indicate that IL 1 beta, among other factors, might also play a regulatory role in the synthesis of NGF in the CNS, as has been demonstrated in the peripheral nervous system (Lindholm, D., R.

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization and RNA blot-hybridization techniques were used (i) to examine the regional distribution of mRNA for a putative kainate receptor in adult rat brain and ii) to test the possibility that seizures affect expression of the receptor gene. The highest densities of hybridization were distributed within hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells, medial habenula, Purkinje cells and the molecular layer of cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. Recurrent limbic seizures caused a massive, delayed, and reversible reduction in levels of the kainate receptor mRNA in dentate gyrus; lesser decreases were found in pyramidal cell fields of hippocampus and superficial cortex. These findings provide evidence that unusual patterns of physiological activity can alter genomic expression for a subclass of glutamate receptors in brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Thresholds of induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and heat shock cognate protein (HSC) 70 mRNAs after transient global ischemia in gerbil brain were investigated by in situ hybridization using cloned cDNA probes selective for each mRNA species. In sham control brain, HSP70 mRNA was little present, while HSC70 mRNA was present in most cell populations. A 0.5-min occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries did not affect the amount of HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs. The selective induction of HSC70 mRNA was observed in dentate granule cells at 1 h, and in most cells of hippocampus especially dentate gyrus at 3 h after 1 min of ischemia when induction of HSP70 mRNA was not evident in the identical brain. The selective induction diminished by 2 days. However, after 2 min of ischemia, HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs were induced together in hippocampal cells from 1 h of the reperfusion, and the co-induction prolonged in CA1 cells until 2 days. Body temperatures monitored at rectum increased after the reperfusion with a peak at 30 min. The degree of increase of the body temperature was significantly higher in the case after 2-min ischemia than in the cases after 0.5- and 1-min ischemia. Although HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs are generally co-induced in stressful conditions, our results suggest the different thresholds of the induction between HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs after transient brain ischemia. The selective induction of HSC70 mRNA which is not accompanied by the induction of HSP70 mRNA may relate to the differences of the duration of ischemia and the degree of the increase of body temperature after ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Rapid and transient increases in cellular immediate early gene and neuropeptide mRNAs in cortical and limbic areas after amygdaloid kindling seizures in the rat.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Changes in transcription factor and neuropeptide gene expression are likely to be involved in the cascade of genetic and molecular events leading to permanent changes in neuronal activity associated with kindling and epilepsy. Both acute-transient and delayed-sustained changes in transcription factor or immediate early gene (IEG) activity have previously been reported in response to different stimuli. In the present study in situ hybridization was used to investigate the possible time course (30 min-8 week) of IEG and neuropeptide mRNA induction in forebrain in a kindling model of epilepsy. Kindling was produced by daily unilateral stimulation of the amygdala. IEG mRNAs were detected using [35S]-labelled oligonucleotide probes specific for c-fos, c-jun, NGFI-A (PC1) and PC3 transcripts. Possible changes in the level of mRNAs encoding the neuropeptides somatostatin (SOM) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were also studied. Stimulation-induced seizures produced dramatic bilateral increases in all IEG mRNAs in the dentate gyrus after 30 min to 1 h. Ipsilateral or bilateral increases in c-fos and PC3 mRNA were observed in the piriform cortex of individual animals at 30 min post-stimulation. While the distribution and apparent basal expression of the different IEGs varied (NGFI-A and c-jun > c-fos and PC3), the degree of induction in the dentate gyrus was similar for all IEGs studied (i.e. 200-300%). No long-term changes in IEG mRNA expression were detected beyond 2 h and up to 8 week after the last seizure. Increased levels of preproSOM and preproNPY mRNAs were consistently observed in hilar interneurons, but not in pyramidal or granule cells of the hippocampus, after 1-2 h. These increases were not maintained at later times. The short-term effects on IEG and neuropeptide mRNAs observed suggest that these changes are consequence of seizure activity with the development of kindling. In contrast, no evidence was found of any substantial, long-lasting effects on these parameters associated with the established kindled state.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'mRNA distribution within dendrites: relationship to afferent innervation.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The majority of neuronal mRNAs are confined to cell bodies, but a few mRNAs are present at high levels in dendrites. Here we report an initial analysis of the relationship between afferent innervation and the distribution of mRNA within dendritic fields. In situ hybridization techniques were used to compare the subcellular distribution of dendritic mRNAs in principal neurons of the hippocampal formation in vivo. The mRNA encoding the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CAMII kinase) was present at high levels throughout the layers that contain the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. In contrast, the mRNA encoding the high molecular weight microtubule-associated protein MAP2 had a more limited distribution. In the dentate gyrus, labeling for MAP2 was present in a discrete band in the lamina containing proximal dendrites and decreased to low levels in laminae containing distal dendrites. This laminar pattern resembles the distinct terminations of the commissural/associational projection (high MAP2 labeling) and the entorhinal projection (lower MAP2 labeling) upon dendrites of granule cells. To determine if the differential distribution of dendritic mRNAs was regulated by either the presence or activity of afferents, we evaluated mRNA distribution in the dentate molecular layer following (1) removal of the entorhinal input by lesions of the entorhinal cortex or (2) prolonged delivery of potentiating stimulation to entorhinal afferents. Denervation led to modest decreases in the levels of mRNAs for both CAMII and MAP2 but did not lead to detectable alterations in mRNA distribution. Also, prolonged stimulation did not lead to detectable alterations in MAP2 or CAMII mRNA distribution although such stimulation clearly elevated the expression of mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The interaction between corticosterone and hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was investigated in male rats. Two days after adrenalectomy, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was increased in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Injection of corticosterone led to a significant dose-dependent and transient suppression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA. The effect of a low dose of corticosterone (50 micrograms/kg) could be blocked by RU 28318, a specific mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, but not by RU 38486, a glucocorticoid antagonist. The effect of a higher dose of corticosterone (300 micrograms/kg) could be partially blocked by RU 28318, whereas there was no additional effect of RU 38486. These results point to a stringent regulation of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors by corticosterone that is predominantly mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Subunit-specific antibodies to all the gamma subunit isoforms described in mammalian brain (gamma(1), gamma(2S), gamma(2L), and gamma(3) have been made. The proportion of GABA(A) receptors containing each gamma subunit isoform in various brain regions has been determined by quantitative immunoprecipitation. In all tested regions of the rat brain, the gamma(1) and gamma(3) subunits are present in considerable smaller proportion of GABA(A) receptor than the gamma(2) subunit. Immunocytochemistry shows that gamma(1) immunoreactivity concentrates in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the dentate gyrus, gamma(1) immunoreactivity concentrates on the outer 2/3 of the molecular layer coinciding with the localization of the axospinous synapses of the perforant pathway. In contrast, gamma(3) immunoreactivity concentrates on the basket cells and other GABAergic local circuit neurons of the hilus. These cells are also rich in gamma(2S). In the cerebellum, gamma(1)++ immunolabeling was localized on the Bergmann glia. The gamma(2S) and gamma(2L) subunits are differentially expressed in various brain regions. Thus the gamma(2S) is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus whereas the gamma(2L) is very abundant in inferior colliculus and cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells, as immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization and immunoprecipitation techniques have revealed. The gamma(2S) and gamma(2L) coexist in some brain areas and cell types. Moreover, the gamma(2S) and gamma(2L) subunits can coexist in the same GABA(A) receptor pentamer. We have shown that this is the case in some GABA(A) receptors expressed in cerebellar granule cells. These GABA(A) receptors also have alpha and beta subunits forming the pentamer. Immunoblots have shown that the rat gamma(1), gamma(2S), gamma(2L) and gamma(3) subunits are peptides of 47, 45, 47 and 44 kDa respectively. Results also indicate that there are aging-related changes in the expression of the gamma(2S) and gamma(2L) subunits in various brain regions which suggest the existence of aging-related changes in the subunit composition of the GABA(A) receptors which in turn might lead to changes in receptor pharmacology. The results obtained with the various gamma subunit isoforms are discussed in terms of the high molecular and binding heterogeneity of the native GABA(A) receptors in brain.',\n",

It shared 99% and 76% identities with mouse and chicken homologs, respectively, at the amino acid sequence level. During postnatal development of the rat brain, cells expressing F3 mRNA appeared in the cortex, hippocampus, superior and inferior colliculi, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory bulb and cerebellum, whereas little was observed at postnatal day 1 (P1). Extraordinarily high expression of F3 mRNA was observed in the cerebral cortical neurons of layer 5 at P7. The number of cells with high expression of F3 mRNA expanded to the entire region of the cerebral cortex at P14. The whole cerebrum displayed expression at P90 in which the cortex still showed the highest expression level, although the overall signals were weak in comparison with those at P14. In the hippocampal formation, F3-expressing granule cells of the dentate gyrus were restricted to the outer aspect, then expanded to the inner aspect during development. Finally the granule cells in the entire region of the dentate gyrus transcribed F3 mRNA. We discuss the significance of the expression pattern of F3 mRNA during development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies have demonstrated that neuropeptide expression in forebrain neurons is responsive to changes in physiological activity. This is particularly true in the hippocampus where the expression of various neuropeptides has been reported to change in distinct neuronal populations in response to seizure activity. The aim of this work is to review and integrated the information on the pathological changes and functional modifications in neuropeptide systems of the hippocampal formation in kindling and other models of limbic epilepsy. This will be done by presenting a study in which we investigated the changes in the expression of somatostatin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurokinin B (NKB) and cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK) in the rat hippocampal principal neurons during and after kindling of the hippocampus using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis of mRNA. NPY-IR was transiently expressed in the granule cells/mossy fibres after the preconvulsive stage 2 and 2 days but not 1 week after three consecutive tonic-clonic seizures (stage 5). A more pronounced increase was observed in NKB-IR lasting 1 week after kindling acquisition. Only the NKB mRNA expression was enhanced in granule cells at these intervals. At stages 2 and 5, somatostatin- and NPY-IR and their mRNA levels were markedly increased in interneurons in the deep hilus and in the polymorphic cell layer and their presumed projections to the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. NKB- and CCK-IR and their mRNAs were highly expressed in basket cells at both stages of kindling. Their IR was increased in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in the ventral hippocampus. Peptide-containing neurons in the hilus appeared well preserved in spite of a reduction of Nissl stained cells by 24 % in the stimulated and contralateral hippocampus at stage 5. In the hippocampus proper, somatostatin and NPY-IR were enhanced in the stratum lacunosum molecular while CCK-IR fibres and its mRNA were particularly expressed in the pyramidal cell layer. The number of Somatostatin-, NKB- and CCK-IR cells was increased in the subiculum. The intensity of these changes was similar 2 days after stages 2 or 5 of kindling. Less pronounced effects were observed 1 week after kindling completion. These results, in the frame of the literature data, suggest that lasting functional changes occur in distinct neuropeptide-containing neurons during limbic epileptogenesis. This may have profound effects on synaptic transmission and contribute to modulate hippocampal excitability.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"We describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human brain Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate (P(i)) cotransporter (hBNPI). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of hBNPI reveal a protein of 560 amino acids with six to eight putative transmembrane segments. hBNPI shares a high degree of homology with other Na(+)-dependent inorganic P(i) cotransporters, including those found in rat brain and human and rabbit kidney. Expression of hBNPI in COS-1 cells results in Na(+)-dependent P(i) uptake. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that hBNPI mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and most abundantly in neuron-enriched regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus. Moderate levels of expression are also observed in glia-enriched areas such as the corpus callosum, and low levels are observed in the substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, and thalamus. In situ hybridization histochemistry reveals relatively high levels of hBNPI mRNA in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in granule neurons of dentate gyrus. The level of hBNPI mRNA is quite low in fetal compared with adult human brain, suggesting developmental regulation of hBNPI gene expression. Southern analyses of nine eukaryotic genomic DNAs probed under stringent conditions with hBNPI cDNA revealed that the hBNPI gene is highly conserved during vertebrate evolution and that each gene is most likely present as a single copy. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we localized hBNPI to the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13) in close proximity to the late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease locus.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Following LTP induction in freely moving rats, in situ hybridization revealed discrete changes in the expression of one isoform in each of four families of serine/threonine kinases constitutively expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Expression of the alpha isoform of CaMKII showed a transient increase over the soma and a more persistent increase over the dendritic field of dentate granule cells. Of the PKC isoforms, only gamma PKC was up-regulated substantially 2 hr after LTP induction, declining to control levels 48 hr later. An increase in the expression of mRNA for ERK2 and raf-B was seen at 24 hr only. These results show that, during the maintenance phase of LTP in the hippocampus, there are selective increases in the expression of serine/threonine kinases and that these increases have specific and characteristic temporal and spatial profiles.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Distribution of IRK2 inwardly rectifying potassium channel mRNA in the mouse brain was studied using in situ hybridization histochemistry and compared with those of other classical inwardly rectifying potassium channel (IRK1 and IRK3) mRNAs. All these IRK channel mRNAs were detected in neurons, but not in glial cells. Their distribution patterns in the brain were, however, quite divergent: IRK2 mRNA was detected extremely high in granule cells of cerebellum, relatively high in motor trigeminal nucleus and moderate in olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, cerebral cortex, CA1 through CA3 regions of hippocampus, dentate gyrus and pontine nucleus. On the other hand, IRK1 mRNA was expressed throughout whole brain but in particular subsets of neurons, and IRK3 mRNA was in forebrain. Expression of these three IRK mRNAs overlapped in hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebral cortex. This differential distribution of IRK mRNAs suggests that each of these channels has its specific function in regulation of the excitability of brain neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A number of candidate mammalian prohormone processing enzymes related to the yeast Kex2 endoprotease have been cloned and demonstrated to cleave several prohormone precursors at single, pairs and tetra basic amino acid processing sites. We have mapped the distribution of the mRNAs encoding two of these endoproteases in adult rat brain. SPC3 message levels showed a more restricted distribution and generally lower levels than SPC2 transcripts. The highest levels of SPC2 mRNA were found in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, several thalamic nuclei, the habenula and selected nuclei in the hypothalamus. SPC3 mRNA was most abundant in dentate gyrus granule cells, the habenula and selected hypothalamic nuclei. In the hypothalamus overlapping and unique distributions of the two transcripts were seen in the paraventricular nucleus with SPC3 mRNA predominantly expressed in lateral magnocellular cells. Both SPC2 and SPC3 mRNA were upregulated in the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei following chronic salt loading. Combined immunocytochemistry/in situ hybridization histochemistry demonstrated that SPC2 and SPC3 transcripts were both expressed in the vasopressinergic subpopulation of magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic nucleus. SPC3 mRNA, but not SPC2 transcripts, also colocalized with immunoreactive vasopressin-associated neurophysin in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results remain consistent with roles for SPC2 and SPC3 in the biosynthesis of neuropeptides and for a specific role for SPC3 in the processing of provasopressin. Increased levels of SPC2 and SPC3 transcripts following a chronic osmotic stimulus suggests these proteases are coregulated with prohormone substrates and may be useful as an indicator of peptidergic activity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cerebral ischemia induces the expression of a number of proteins that may have an important influence on cellular injury. The purpose of this study was to compare the regional effects of hypoxia-ischemia on the expression of the proto-oncogene, c-fos, and the heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) gene in developing brain. Unilateral hypoxia-ischemia was produced in the brain of immature rats (7, 15, and 23 days after birth) using a combination of carotid artery ligation and systemic hypoxia (8% O2). After recovery for 2 and 24 h, the regional expression of c-fos and HSP-70 mRNA was determined using in situ hybridization. Littermates were permitted to recover for 1 week for assessment of histologic injury. Hypoxia-ischemia increased the expression of both c-fos and HSP-70 mRNA, but the topography of expression varied with the age of the animal as well as the mRNA species. In the 7-day-old group, expression of c-fos at 2 h increased in multiple regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere in nearly one-half of the animals, while HSP-70 mRNA was not expressed until 24 h and, then, predominantly in the hippocampus. In 15- and 23-day-old rats, expression of c-fos was increased at 2 h in the entorhinal cortex and in the dendritic field of the upper blade of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, while HSP-70 mRNA was prominently expressed in neocortex and the cell layers of the hippocampus. Interestingly, the strong expression of HSP-70 mRNA in dentate granule cells did not occur in the innermost layer of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

In situ hybridization analysis showed that these transcripts differ in distribution and in relative abundance. In frontal cortex the alpha 1 and alpha 2 transcripts are most abundant in layers II-IV, whereas the alpha 3 mRNA is most abundant in layers V and VI. In the hippocampal complex, the alpha transcripts are differentially distributed in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. The alpha 2 transcript is enriched in the dentate gyrus and CA4/CA3 regions of the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, essentially only the alpha 1 transcript is detectable in granule cells, Purkinje cells, and stellate/basket cells.

       "  'Abstract': 'Although extracellular matrix (ECM) components have been shown to play important roles in the development of the CNS, expression generally decreases in the adult brain. This study examines the expression of the SPARC-related glycoprotein SC1 in the rat brain during postnatal development and in the adult. In situ hybridization analysis indicates that expression of SC1 mRNA increases in a caudal to rostral manner as postnatal neural development proceeds and is found at near maximal levels in the adult brain. SC1 mRNA is expressed in glial-enriched areas of the brain at postnatal day 1 (P1) and P5. Between P10 and P20, SC1 mRNA increases in neuron-enriched regions of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemistry in the adult shows that SC1 protein is localized to neurons in these regions and to scattered glial cells. Subcellular fractionation demonstrates that the SC1 116/120 kDa doublet is associated with synaptosomes. SC1 is present in the aqueous phase following extraction of membranes with TX-114, suggesting that it is not a transmembrane protein, a property consistent with other adult brain ECM components. Furthermore in cerebellar granule cells grown in culture, high levels of the 120 kDa component are secreted into the media. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that SC1 is an ECM glycoprotein expressed in both the developing and adult brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'An in situ hybridization technique was used to determine the distribution in rat brain of RNA homologous to cDNA clones encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the rat brain GABAA gamma-aminobutyrate receptor. The subunit proteins were mapped in adjacent sections autoradiographically and immunohistochemically. Many brain areas containing high densities of GABAA receptors showed strong hybridization signals with both the alpha- and the beta-subunit antisense RNA probe--e.g., cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. On a cellular level, a dense dendritic localization of GABAA receptors was correlated with a strong hybridization in the corresponding somata--e.g., in mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum. In some brain areas--e.g., substantia nigra--the intensity of the hybridization signal with the beta-subunit probe was much weaker than that with the alpha-subunit probe, whereas the inverse ratio of hybridization intensity was found in others--e.g., in bed nucleus. This regional heterogeneity in the hybridization pattern may reflect regional differences in RNA stability, transcription rate, or subunit composition. The results open the way for studies on the regulation of GABAA-receptor gene expression in normal and pathological brain in situ.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We previously reported a novel human non-receptor tyrosine kinase gene, HYL (hematopoietic consensus tyrosine-lacking kinase) (Sakano et al., 1994), which consists of each of the SH2 (src homology 2), SH3 and tyrosine kinase catalytic domains. HYL has unique structural features shared with CSK (C-terminal Src kinase). Recently it has also been reported that matk (Bennett et al., 1994) and Ctk (Klages et al., 1994) are isolated as novel kinases with structural similarity to CSK. Comparisons of cDNA sequence indicate the HYL, matk and Ctk are the same gene. We further characterized the mouse HYL genomic structure and HYL mRNA expression in mouse brain. The mouse HYL gene is distributed over 5.8 kb and is composed of 12 exons. The exon-intron organization is almost identical with that of human CSK. The mouse HYL gene was assigned to the R-positive C1 band of chromosome 10 by fluorescent in situ hybridization. RNA in situ hybridization demonstrated the broad distribution of HYL mRNA expression in various neuronal cells. Especially, strong signals were detected in Purkinje cells, pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, granule cells in the dentate gyrus, and mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, indicating that mRNA expression of HYL in brain is very similar to that of SRC-family kinases. These findings establish close relationship between the HYL and CSK genes and also suggest that HYL may play an important role in signal transduction through SRC-family kinases in the central nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunoreactivity and gene expression was investigated in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures and pentylenetetrazol kindling in the rat. Pronounced increases of NPY immunoreactivity were found in the terminal field of mossy fibers in both animal models. In kainic acid-treated rats the peptide progressively accumulated in the hilus and the stratum lucidum of CA3, 5-60 days after injection of the toxin and, at the later intervals, extended to the supragranular molecular layer of the dentate gyrus indicating sprouting of these neurons. Unilateral injection of colchicine into the hilus abolished NPY staining of the mossy fibers. Using in situ hybridization, in both animal models markedly enhanced expression of prepro-NPY mRNA was observed in the granular layer, containing the perikarya of the mossy fibers. It is suggested that sustained expression of the neuromodulatory neuropeptide NPY, in addition to the observed plastic changes, may contribute to altered excitability of hippocampal mossy fibers in epilepsy. Neither somatostatin immunoreactivity nor gene expression were enhanced in granule cells/mossy fibers.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2 and delta subunit messenger RNAs of the GABAA receptor was followed by in situ hybridization histochemistry using radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes in sections of embryonic (E12-21) and early postnatal (P1-5) rat. beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2 subunit messenger RNAs were first detectable at E15 in the spinal cord (ventral > dorsal) and lower central nervous system regions (e.g. pons, medulla and thalamus). beta 3 subunit messenger RNA was abundantly expressed in olfactory bulb neurons at E15. At E17, the expression pattern of these subunit messenger RNAs continued in the lower central nervous system. In the upper central nervous system, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 subunit messenger RNAs were first detectable in the outer layer of the hippocampal and entire cortical neuroepithelium. The expression for both beta 3 and gamma 2 subunit messenger RNAs increased significantly over that observed at E15, whereas beta 2 subunit messenger RNA increased to a lesser extent and was more discretely expressed in inferior colliculus, cerebellar neuroepithelium and spinal cord (ventral = dorsal). By E19, messenger RNAs for beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2 subunits a widespread and abundant co-existent distribution throughout the central nervous system. Exceptions to this co-expression were the absence of beta 2 messenger RNA in the dentate gyrus and beta 3 messenger RNA in entorhinal cortex, areas in which they are present in adult. There was also a differential distribution of subunit messenger RNAs in developing olfactory bulb at E19-20: the glomerular cells preferentially expressed beta 3 and gamma 2 subunit messenger RNAs; the mitral cells preferentially expressed beta 2 subunit messenger RNA; inner granule cells expressed moderate levels of beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2 subunit messenger RNAs. Expression of beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2 messenger RNAs was also anatomically co-existent at P5. In addition, significant expression of beta 1 and delta subunit messenger RNAs was apparent in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The identity of the gamma 2 expressed between E15 and E21 was shown to be mostly the short isoform of gamma 2 subunit messenger RNA. Expression of both forms was evident beginning around P3-5. These results indicate that during the late embryonic and early postnatal period of development, beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2 subunit messenger RNAs are abundantly expressed and co-localized to most central nervous system regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'While GABAergic inhibition plays a major role in the regulation of neuronal excitability, a role for altered GABAergic inhibition in the pathogenesis of epilepsy remains to be proven. The demonstration that GABAA receptors are composed of multiple subunits and that the properties and pharmacology of GABAA receptors are different for different subunit combinations, suggests that GABAA receptor heterogeneity may be of importance in determining the properties of GABAergic inhibition in different regions of the nervous system. While it is clear that GABAA receptor heterogeneity is present in the nervous system, a role for receptor heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of epilepsy remains uncertain. GABAA receptor heterogeneity may have implications for the treatment of epilepsy. It is quite possible that drugs which regulate GABAergic function may have variable efficacy in different regions of the nervous system due to expression of receptors with subunits that have different sensitivity to allosteric regulators. In situ hybridization studies indicate the colocalization of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L and delta subunit mRNAs in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells while only the alpha 1, beta 1 and gamma 2L and not the delta subunit mRNAs colocalize in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. The reduced rate of acute desensitization and the slow recovery of GABA-evoked currents typical of delta-containing subunit combinations could generate tonic inhibition via long-lasting IPSPs in the dentate gyrus and thus play a role in preventing seizures. By the same rationale, a reduction in the level of expression of the delta subunit mRNA in the dentate gyrus or its absence as in the hippocampal pyramidal cells could be associated with a reduced seizure threshold. Furthermore, it is likely that there are developmental changes in the stoichiometry or subunit composition of GABAA receptors rendering the developing nervous system more or less sensitive to the effects of GABAergic anticonvulsant drugs. In addition to the heterogeneous expression of GABAA receptors, other issues concerning the regulation of GABAergic function are of potential importance. The regulatory events that control the expression of specific receptor subtypes and levels of GABA receptors are unknown. To understand the role of GABAA receptor heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of epilepsy will require the combination of biophysical and molecular biological techniques. It will be important to determine not only whether the properties of GABAA receptors have been altered in a specific form of epilepsy but also whether gene expression has been altered.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Several isoforms of the NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) subunits of the ionotropic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor contain a consensus site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) which, once phosphorylated results in an increased conductance through the receptor channel. Using in situ hybridization, we investigated the expression of NR1 subunits sensitive or insensitive to modification by PKC in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). A selective 50% increase only in the levels of mRNA NR1 subunits containing this consensus sequence for PKC phosphorylation was seen 48 h after LTP induction. The change in the expression of PKC-sensitive NR1 subunits may be the molecular basis for the increased response of the post-synaptic cell to released glutamate during the maintenance phase of LTP.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Distribution of mRNAs coding for liver and heart gap junction proteins in the rat central nervous system.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The present study examined the distributions of connexin43 mRNA and connexin32 mRNA in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. These connexins are the best studied gap junction proteins; connexin32 forms direct cell-cell channels in the liver, as does connexin43 in the heart. There was a differential distribution of cells containing connexin32 mRNA compared with the population of cells which contained connexin43 mRNA, thus implying a regional specificity in the expression of connexins in the CNS. Cells containing connexin43 mRNA were uniformly distributed throughout the gray matter of the neuraxis. Several areas had a higher concentration of cells that express connexin43, such as layer IA of the piriform cortex, supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, anterior cortical amygdaloid nucleus, the reticular part of the substantia nigra, lateral habenula, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, facial nucleus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and dorsal cochlear nucleus. The pattern of connexin43 hybridization and the morphology of connexin43 mRNA containing cells suggest that this gap junction forming protein is found predominantly in astrocytes. Connexin32 mRNA was detected in discrete cell groups of the gray matter that appeared to be neurons, including cells in layer 2 of the neocortex, layer II of the piriform cortex, pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, granule and polymorphic cell layers of the dentate gyrus, islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle, lateral thalamic nuclei, lateral habenula, and Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. A large population of cells in white matter tracts that were labelled with the connexin32 riboprobe appeared to be oligodendrocytes. These studies suggest that neurons and glial cells express connexin32 mRNA, but only astrocytes express connexin43 mRNA. Many of the areas in which connexin mRNAs were demonstrated have electrically coupled cells, morphologically distinct gap junction plaques, and/or have immunocytochemically identifiable connexin proteins. These results indicate that cells with mRNAs coding for intercellular channels have a widespread distribution in the mammalian CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A family of 4 rat muscarinic receptors (m1, m2, m3, and m4) have recently been cloned and sequenced (Bonner et al., 1987). Since pharmacological probes that are presently available do not appear to distinguish among 3 of these muscarinic receptors, we constructed oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the N-terminal sequences of the muscarinic receptors and used them to specifically localize m1, m2, m3, and m4 mRNA in sections of rat brain using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Northern analysis demonstrated a 3.1 kilobase (kb) m 1 mRNA, a 4.5 kb m3 mRNA, and a 3.3 kb m4 mRNA in cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In situ hybridization histochemistry indicated a prevalence of m1 mRNA in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the olfactory bulb, amygdala, olfactory tubercule, and piriform cortex. Caudate putamen and cerebral cortex showed moderate levels of labeling. m2 mRNA was detectable in the medial septum, diagonal band, olfactory bulb, and pontine nuclei. m3 and m4 mRNA were also prevalent in the olfactory bulb and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus but were present only in low levels in the dentate gyrus. m3 mRNA was present in superficial and deep layers of the cerebral cortex, whereas m4 mRNA was more evenly distributed with a slightly more intense labeling evident in the midcortical layer. In addition, m3 mRNA was present in a number of thalamic nuclei and brain-stem nuclei, while m4 mRNA predominated in the caudate putamen. These data offer a new basis on which to interpret the heterogeneity of muscarinic actions in the CNS.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Trans-synaptic activation of gene expression is linked to long-term plastic adaptations in the nervous system. To examine the molecular program induced by synaptic activity, we have employed molecular cloning techniques to identify an immediate early gene that is rapidly induced in the brain. We here report the entire nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, which encodes an open reading frame of 396 amino acids. Within the hippocampus, constitutive expression was low. Basal levels of expression in the cortex were high but can be markedly reduced by blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. By contrast, synaptic activity induced by convulsive seizures increased mRNA levels in neurons of the cortex and hippocampus. High-frequency stimulation of the perforant path resulted in long-term potentiation and a spatially confined dramatic increase in the level of mRNA in the granule cells of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. Transcripts were localized to the soma and to the dendrites of the granule cells. The dendritic localization of the transcripts offers the potential for local synthesis of the protein at activated postsynaptic sites and may underlie synapse-specific modifications during long-term plastic events.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Functional expression of the rat brain alpha 1A Ca channel was obtained by nuclear injection of an expression plasmid into Xenopus oocytes. The alpha 1A Ca current activated quickly, inactivated slowly, and showed a voltage dependence typical of high voltage-activated Ca channels. The alpha 1A current was partially blocked (approximately 23%) by omega-agatoxin IVA (200 nM) and substantially blocked by omega-conotoxin MVIIC (5 microM blocked approximately 70%). Bay K 8644 (10 microM) or omega-conotoxin GVIA (1 microM) had no significant effect on the alpha 1A current. Coexpression with rat brain Ca channel beta subunits increased the alpha 1A whole-cell current and shifted the current-voltage relation to more negative values. While the beta 1b and beta 3 subunits caused a significant acceleration of the alpha 1A inactivation kinetics, the beta 2a subunit dramatically slowed the inactivation of the alpha 1A current to that seen typically for P-type Ca currents. In situ localization with antisense deoxyoligonucleotide and RNA probes showed that alpha 1A was widely distributed throughout the rat central nervous system, with moderate to high levels in the olfactory bulb, in the cerebral cortex, and in the CA fields and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, prominent alpha 1A expression was detected in Purkinje cells with some labeling also in granule cells. Overall, the results show that alpha 1A channels are widely expressed and share some properties with both Q- and P-type channels.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To evaluate the cellular response to traumatic brain injury, the expression of mRNA for c-fos and the 72-kDa heat shock protein (hsp72) was determined using in situ hybridization following lateral fluid-percussion injury (2.2-2.4 atm) in rat brain. At 2 h after injury, induction of c-fos mRNA was observed throughout the cortex ipsilateral to the site of injury, while increased expression of hsp72 mRNA was restricted to regions of the cortex surrounding the contusion area. An increase in c-fos mRNA, but not hsp72 mRNA, was observed bilaterally in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in the thalamus ipsilateral to the impact site. By 6 h, increased expression of c-fos mRNA was observed only in the corpus callosum on the impact side; hsp72 mRNA persisted in the deep cortical layers and upper layers of the subcortical white matter below the site of maximal injury. By 24 h, both c-fos and hsp72 mRNA had returned to control levels in all regions of the brain. These results demonstrate that lateral fluid-percussion brain injury triggers regionally and temporally specific expression of c-fos and hsp72 mRNA, which may be suggestive of differential neurochemical alterations in neurons and glia following experimental brain injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cortistatin is a presumptive neuropeptide that shares 11 of its 14 amino acids with somatostatin. In contrast to somatostatin, administration of cortistatin into the rat brain ventricles specifically enhances slow wave sleep, apparently by antagonizing the effects of acetylcholine on cortical excitability. Here we show that preprocortistatin mRNA is expressed in a subset of GABAergic cells in the cortex and hippocampus that partially overlap with those containing somatostatin. A significant percentage of cortistatin-positive neurons is also positive for parvalbumin. In contrast, no colocalization was found between cortistatin and calretinin, cholecystokinin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide. During development there is a transient increase in cortistatin-expressing cells in the second postnatal week in all cortical areas and in the dentate gyrus. A transient expression of preprocortistatin mRNA in the hilar region at P16 is paralleled by electrophysiological changes in dentate granule cells. Together, these observations suggest mechanisms by which cortistatin may regulate cortical activity.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting induced by chronic electroconvulsive seizures.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Stress, which can precipitate and exacerbate depression, causes atrophy and in severe cases death of hippocampal neurons. Atrophy of the hippocampus has also been observed in patients suffering from recurrent major depression. The present study examines the influence of electroconvulsive seizures, one of the most effective treatments for depression, on the morphology and survival of hippocampal neurons. The results demonstrate that chronic administration of electroconvulsive seizures induces sprouting of the granule cell mossy fiber pathway in the hippocampus. This sprouting is dependent on repeated administration of electroconvulsive seizures, reaches a maximum 12 days after the last treatment and is long lasting (i.e. up to six months). Electroconvulsive seizure-induced sprouting occurs in the absence of neuronal loss, indicating that sprouting is not a compensatory response to cell death. This is different from the sprouting induced by kindling or excitotoxin treatment, which induce cell death along with recurrent seizures. Electroconvulsive seizure-induced sprouting is significantly diminished in brain-derived neurotrophic factor heterozygote knockout mice, indicating that this neurotrophic factor contributes to mossy fiber sprouting. However, infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor into the hippocampus does not induce sprouting of the mossy fiber pathway. The results demonstrate that chronic administration of electroconvulsive seizures induces mossy fiber sprouting and suggest that increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor is necessary, but not sufficient for the induction of this sprouting. Although the functional consequences remain unclear, sprouting of the mossy fiber pathway would appear to oppose the actions of stress and could thereby contribute to the therapeutic actions of electroconvulsive seizure therapy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Polysialic acid on the neural cell adhesion molecule is developmentally regulated and has been implicated in the plasticity of cell-cell interactions. The sialyltransferases ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV are able to catalyze the synthesis of polysialic acid. This study compares the expression of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV mRNA during postnatal rat brain development. Northern blot analysis indicated a substantial down-regulation of ST8Sia II from high expression at postnatal day 2 to almost undetectable levels at the age of 6 months. In contrast, the decline of ST8Sia IV content was moderate. In the mature brain, ST8Sia IV is the predominant polysialyltransferase. In situ hybridization of selected brain regions at postnatal days 2, 11, and 21 confirmed the decline of ST8Sia II level in isocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. ST8Sia II was not detectable at any time point in the subependymal layer and the layers of the olfactory bulb. Persistent ST8Sia IV expression was localized in the subependymal layer, the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in some widely dispersed cells of the isocortex. The distinct expression patterns of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV suggest their differential regulation. As discussed with regard to the persistent polysialic acid expression, ST8Sia IV should receive particular attention in the mature brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have raised affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies specific for the inward rectifying K+ channel (IRK1/Kir2.1) and the G protein-activated inward rectifying K+ channel (GIRK1/Kir3.1) examined their distributions in the rat brain immunohistochemically. The regional expression pattern of the IRK1 and GIRK1 proteins were similar to those of mRNA of the previous in situ hybridization study. The subcellular distribution was studied in the cerebellum; cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the cerebellum, the IRK1 protein was clearly detected in the somata and proximal dendrites of Purkinje cells, while the GIRK1 protein was present in the somata and clustered dendrites of granule cells. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, both IRK1- and GIRK1-immunoreactivities were detected in the somata and apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells. The presence of IRK1 or GIRK1 proteins in the axons could not proved by the present study. The developmental changes of the expression pattern of the GIRK1 protein were also investigated in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum of postnatal day (P) 7 to P17 rats. The GIRK1 protein was detected neither in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus nor in the proliferative zone of the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum, in which granule cell precursors are reported to proliferate, while it was clearly detected in the adjacent layer in which postmitotic but immature cells exist. These results imply that the expression of the GIRK1 protein starts just after the neuronal precursors finished the last mitotic cell division.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In fibroblasts, serum stimulation has been shown to activate the immediate-early gene 3CH134 encoding a dual specificity protein phosphatase that regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase. We report here that 3CH134 messenger RNA levels increase during recirculation following 30 min forebrain ischemia in the rat brain. In normal rat brains, 3CH134 messenger RNA was found mainly in neurons of the cortex and thalamus. At recirculation periods up to 1 h after 30 min ischemia, 3CH134 messenger RNA increased in neurons and glial cells of all previously ischemic brain regions. After 3 and 6 h recirculation, a prominent increase of 3CH134 messenger RNA was observed in the pyramidal cell layer of all sectors of the hippocampus and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, whereas in the other brain regions messenger RNA levels returned to control. Up to 6 h of recirculation the spatial induction pattern of 3CH134 was similar to the pattern observed for the immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun. Within the hippocampus a similar pattern was also observed for the heat shock protein hsp70 messenger RNA. At 12 and 24 h after ischemia, increased levels of 3CH134 messenger RNA persisted in hippocampal neurons; at the same time a delayed increase of 3CH134 messenger RNA was observed in large neurons of the thalamus and in glial cells in damaged regions of the striatum. At later survival periods, 3CH134 messenger RNA returned to control levels. Our study shows that the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3CH134 is induced in the brain after a period of global ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Programs of gene activation may underlie long-term adaptive cellular responses to extracellular ligands. We have used a differential cDNA cloning strategy to identify genes that are strongly induced by excitatory stimuli in the adult rat hippocampus. Here, we report the rat cDNA sequence of a zinc-finger transcription factor, Egr3/Pilot, and characterize its regulated mRNA expression in brain. Egr3 mRNA is rapidly and transiently induced in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex by electroconvulsive seizure. mRNA levels peak 2 hr after the seizure and remain elevated for as long as 8 hr. Egr3 mRNA is also rapidly induced in granule cells of the dentate gyrus by synaptic NMDA receptor activation elicited by patterned stimulation of the perforant pathway and by drugs that alter dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum. Basal levels of Egr3 mRNA in the cortex appear to be driven by natural synaptic activity because monocular deprivation rapidly decreases Egr3 mRNA in the deafferented visual cortex. Aspects of the protein structure, sequence-specific DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and regulation of Egr3 are highly similar to another zinc-finger transcription factor, Egr1/zif268. Moreover, we demonstrate colocalization of Egr3 and zif268 mRNAs in neurons of normal and stimulated cortex. Our studies suggest that interactions between these coregulated transcription factors may be important in defining long-term, neuroplastic responses.',\n",

In order to study the localization and expression of the different alpha isoform mRNAs on a regional and cellular level in the brain, we prepared probes from the unique 3' untranslated region of rat alpha 1 cDNA and from a segment containing a portion of the translated region of rat alpha 3 cDNA. These probes were used in dot blot and in situ hybridization assays of rat brain. 3. alpha 1 mRNA was found predominantly in cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus of hippocampus, and specific isolated brain-stem nuclei such as locus ceruleus and motor nuclei V and VII. In contrast alpha 3 mRNA was found predominantly in pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of cerebral cortex, in both pyramidal and dentate gyrus neurons of the hippocampus, and in neurons of most subcortical structures of the thalamus, basal ganglia, and brain-stem nuclei. 4. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells showed predominantly alpha 3, as did stellate and basket cells. The granule cells contained predominantly alpha 1. 5. These experiments show that mRNAs for both alpha 1 and alpha 3 isoforms of (Na,K)-ATPase are found in neurons of the CNS. The isoforms have unique cellular and regional distributions, which in some cases overlap.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Cellular pattern of type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor gene expression during maturation of the rat brain: comparison with insulin-like growth factors I and II.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Insulin-like growth factors have a number of potent trophic effects on cultured neural tissue and most if not all of these effects appear to be mediated by the type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor. In order to establish the identity of cell types expressing this receptor in the rat central nervous system during development and maturity, we have used in situ hybridization to map sites of type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor mRNA synthesis in the developing and adult rat brain. In order to identify possible local sources of peptide ligands for this receptor, we have also mapped the sites of insulin-like growth factors I and II mRNA synthesis in parallel brain sections. From early development onward, there is a uniform and stable pattern of type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor gene expression in all neuroepithelial cell lineages, in which regional variations reflect primarily differences in cell density. In addition to this generalized pattern, during late postnatal development, high levels of type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor gene expression are found in specific sets of sensory and cerebellar projection neurons in conjunction with abundant insulin-like growth factor-I gene expression in these same neurons. While insulin-like growth factor-I expression is confined to the principal neurons in each system, receptor mRNA is also found in local interneurons. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation, type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor mRNA and insulin-like growth factor-I are concentrated in different cell populations: receptor mRNA is abundant in pyramidal cells in Ammon's horn, in granule cells in the dentate gyrus, and in pyramidal cells in lamina VI of the cerebral cortex. Insulin-like growth factor-I mRNA is found in isolated medium- to large-sized cells which are rather irregularly distributed throughout the hippocampus and isocortex. In the hypothalamus, receptor mRNA is concentrated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus but is in low abundance elsewhere, including the median eminence, while insulin-like growth factor-I mRNA is not detected in this region at all. Type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor-II mRNAs are both abundant in choroid plexus, meninges and vascular sheaths from early development to maturity, but insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA is not detected in cells of neuroepithelial origin at any stage of development. This study provides evidence for two fundamentally different patterns of gene expression for the brain type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) is one of four major serine-threonine specific phosphoprotein phosphatases which modulate various intracellular activities. By in situ hybridization analysis of the adult rat, expression signals of mRNA for PP2C were observed most highly in the granule cells and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and plexus choroideus of the lateral ventricle, whereas moderate levels of its expression were observed in the medial habenula, piriform cortex and the pineal body. Several discrete nuclei of the brainstem including pars compacta of the substantia nigra, the pontine nuclei, and the locus ceruleus expressed the mRNA moderately. Weak expression of PP2C mRNA was observed in mitral and internal granule cells of the olfactory bulb, spinal cord gray matter, the cerebral neocortex, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. Only faint expression was detected in the caudate putamen. These patterns of expression are different from that of calcineurin/PP2B reported by other immunohistochemical studies and it is suggested that various neuronal proteins are differentially dephosphorylated by the different types of PP.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'A novel endothelin receptor type-B-like gene enriched in the brain.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"We report here our effort of cloning and characterization of a novel human gene, which encodes a putative human endothelin receptor type B like protein (hET(B)R-LP), from a human hippocampus tissue cDNA library. hET(B)R-LP consists of 614 amino acids with seven putative transmembrane domains. The deduced amino acid sequence of hET(B)R-LP is 52% similar and 26.7% identical to human endothelin type B receptor. A 4.0 kb mRNA of hET(B)R-LP is abundantly expressed in the human brain. The results of in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase in situ gene amplification reveal tissue distribution and cellular localization of signals of hET(B)R-LP mRNA in the neuronal cells, particularly concentrated in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and neuronal cells of the hippocampus of human brain, including pyramidal cells of Ammon's horn and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. A 4.0 kb mRNA of hET(B)R-LP is also less abundantly expressed in the liver and the placenta. Expression of recombinant protein, hET(B)R-LP/HA, in cells of COS7 and HEK293 transfected with plasmid DNA, hET(B)R-LP/HA/pcDNA1/Amp, was confirmed by Northern blot analysis and by immunofluorescence staining of cells with anti-HA antibody. Specific binding of radiolabeled ET-1 and ET-3 to membrane preparations and to intact cells expressing recombinant protein of hET(B)R-LP/HA did not show any significant difference of binding properties between cells transfected with plasmid DNA, hET(B)R-LP/HA/pcDNA1/Amp, and cells untransfected, including both COS7 cells and HEK293 cells. The results of assays of measuring Ca++ mobilization and cAMP production in HEK293 cells indicate that ET-1, ET-3, bombesin and neuropeptide Y are unable to produce any kind of significant difference of Ca++ mobilization and cAMP production between HEK293 cells expressing recombinant protein and HEK293 cells untransfected or HEK293 cells transfected with vector DNA only (pcDNA1/Amp) in functional assays performed. Therefore, its ligand and physiological significance of hET(B)R-LP remains to be discovered.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'The mas proto-oncogene is developmentally regulated in the rat central nervous system.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The mas proto-oncogene encodes a protein with a predicted structure similar to members of the family of seven transmembrane domain spanning receptors. These receptors are thought to transduce extracellular signals to G-proteins. Angiotensin II and III have been reported to be the functional ligands for the mas oncogene-encoded receptor (Jackson et al., 1988). We show here using in situ hybridization histochemistry and RNase protection assays that mas mRNA is expressed in a subpopulation of neurons in both the adult and developing rat CNS. In the adult CNS, mas mRNA is most abundant in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells; mas transcripts are also present at low levels in the cortex and thalamus. mas is first expressed in the developing rat CNS at postnatal day 1 (P1). Even at this early stage in CNS development the pattern of mas expression is similar to that seen in the adult. Although at P1 most neurons of the dentate gyrus are not yet generated and cells of the hippocampal CA fields are undergoing migration and synaptogenesis (Bayer 1980; Altman and Bayer, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c), mas is specifically expressed in these cell populations. This extremely restricted pattern of expression suggests that mas may function in determining the morphology and connections of specific cell types in the hippocampus. This function may in part be carried out by the ability of mas to link external cues to intracellular processes.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'mRNA for the m4 muscarinic receptor subtype is expressed in adult rat brain cholinergic neurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'A number of pharmacological, anatomical, and immunological studies have previously addressed the subtype identity of the hippocampal muscarinic pre-synaptic autoreceptor. A preponderance of findings indicate that it is of the M2 pharmacological type. Both the m2 and m4 molecular subtypes exhibit M2 pharmacology and there are few drugs that differentiate between these receptors. Pharmacological attempts at defining the hippocampal autoreceptor have yielded conflicting results. The basal forebrain is relatively enriched in m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA and protein, and lesions that denervate the hippocampus of its basal forebrain cholinergic input have shown a decrement in m2, but not m4, receptor protein in the hippocampus. Thus, the anatomical data obtained to date tend to support the view that the m2 subtype is expressed as the hippocampal autoreceptor. We have combined in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with immunocytochemistry to choline acetyltransferase to examine whether mRNA for the m4 subtype of muscarinic receptor is expressed in central cholinergic neurons. The m4 muscarinic mRNA was found at moderate levels in all subdivisions of the cholinergic basal forebrain, including the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MS/DB). The m4 mRNA was also found in striatal cholinergic interneurons, in the cholinergic reticular core of the upper brainstem, and in brainstem cholinergic motor neurons. Muscarinic m4 receptor mRNA was also found in many non-cholinergic cells in the brain. For example, the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, dentate gyrus granule cells, and entorhinal cortical pyramidal neurons express relatively high levels of m4 mRNA, while in the brainstem the dorsal raphe and pontine reticular nuclei express relatively high levels of this mRNA. The finding of m4 mRNA in the MS/DB cholinergic neurons suggests that this receptor protein might be expressed as an autoreceptor in hippocampal cholinergic terminals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previous studies have suggested that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in memory and learning, and may be neuroprotective following various brain insults. Exercise has been found to increase BDNF mRNA levels in various brain regions, including specific subpopulations of hippocampal neurons. In the present study, we were interested in whether following traumatic brain injury, exercise could increase BDNF mRNA expression, attenuate neuropathology, and improve cognitive and neuromoter performance. We subjected adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to a fluid percussion brain injury, followed by either 18 days of treadmill exercise or handling. Spatial memory was evaluated in a Morris Water Maze (MWM) and motor function was evaluated with a battery of neuromotor tests. Neuropathology was evaluated by measuring the cortical lesion volume and the extent of neuronal loss in the hipocampus. Expression of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus was assessed with in situ hybridization and densitometry. Hybridization signal for BDNF mRNA was significantly increased bilaterally in the exercise group in hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3 (p<0.05), but not in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. No significant differences were observed between the groups in neuropathology, spatial memory, or motor performance. This study suggests that after traumatic brain injury, exercise elevates BDNF mRNA in specific regions of the hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have localized brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in rat brain and examined its regulation by seizure activity. In situ hybridization of BDNF 35S-cRNA most prominently labeled neurons in hippocampal stratum pyramidale and stratum granulosum, superficial olfactory cortex, pyramidal cell layers of neocortex, amygdala, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, anterior olfactory nucleus, and ventromedial hypothalamus. Hybridization to BDNF mRNA was markedly increased in all of these regions after lesion-induced recurrent limbic seizures and within dentate gyrus granule cells following one electrically stimulated epileptiform afterdischarge. In contrast to seizure-elicited changes in nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression, increases in BDNF mRNA occur in a greater number of different neuronal populations and develop several hours more rapidly in extrahippocampal loci. These results indicate that regulation by physiological activity may be an intrinsic property of this class of neurotrophic factor but that, in the recurrent seizure paradigm, different mechanisms mediate increased expression of mRNAs for BDNF and NGF outside hippocampus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The recently discovered regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins potently modulate the functioning of heterotrimeric G-proteins by stimulating the GTPase activity of G-protein alpha subunits. The mRNAs for numerous subtypes of putative RGS proteins have been identified in mammalian tissues, but little is known about their expression in brain. We performed a systematic survey of the localization of mRNAs encoding nine of these RGSs, RGS3-RGS11, in brain by in situ hybridization. Striking region-specific patterns of expression were observed. Five subtypes, RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, RGS9, and RGS10 mRNAs, are densely expressed in brain, whereas the other subtypes (RGS3, RGS5, RGS6, and RGS11) are expressed at lower density and in more restricted regions. RGS4 mRNA is notable for its dense expression in neocortex, piriform cortex, caudoputamen, and ventrobasal thalamus. RGS8 mRNA is highly expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer as well as in several midbrain nuclei. RGS9 mRNA is remarkable for its nearly exclusive enrichment in striatal regions. RGS10 mRNA is densely expressed in dentate gyrus granule cells, superficial layers of neocortex, and dorsal raphe. To assess whether the expression of RGS mRNAs can be regulated, we examined the effect of an acute seizure on levels of RGS7, RGS8, and RGS10 mRNAs in hippocampus. Of the three subtypes, changes in RGS10 levels were most pronounced, decreasing by approximately 40% in a time-dependent manner in response to a single seizure. These results, which document highly specific patterns of RGS mRNA expression in brain and their ability to be regulated in a dynamic manner, support the view that RGS proteins may play an important role in determining the intensity and specificity of signaling pathways in brain as well as their adaptations to synaptic activity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) using synthetic oligonucleotide probes has been used to identify cells containing the mRNAs coding for glutaminase (GluT), aspartate aminotransferase (AspT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). The distribution of GAD mRNA confirms previous descriptions and matches the distribution of GAD detected using specific antibodies. AspT mRNA is widely distributed in the brain, but is present at high levels in GABAergic neuronal populations, some that may be glutamatergic, and in a subset of neurons which do not contain significant levels of either GAD or GluT mRNA. Particularly prominent are the neurons of the magnocellular division of the red nucleus, the large cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei and the vestibular nuclei and neurons of the lateral superior olivary nucleus. GluT mRNA does not appear to be present at high levels in all GAD-containing neurons, but is seen prominently in many neuronal populations that may use glutamate as a neurotransmitter, such as neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells, the granule cells of the cerebellum and neurons of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The heaviest labelling of GluT mRNA is seen in the lateral reticular nucleus of the medulla. ISHH using probes directed against the mRNAs encoding these enzymes may be an important technique for identifying glutamate and aspartate using neuronal populations and for examining their regulation in a variety of experimental and pathological circumstances.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'GABAA receptors, the major synaptic targets for the neurotransmitter GABA, constitute gated chloride channels. By their allosteric, drug-induced modulation, they serve as control elements for the regulation of anxiety, vigilance, and epileptiform activity. The structural requirements of fully functional GABAA receptors in the mammalian brain have remained elusive so far. We report here on the cloning of the gamma 2-subunit cDNA of rat brain and its functional analysis by coexpression with the alpha 1- and beta 1-subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and on the sites of gene expression of the 3 subunits in the rat brain. The recombinant receptor displayed GABA-inducible currents (Imax = 6 microA; Ka = 75 microM) which were allosterically modulated by benzodiazepine receptor ligands (enhancement and inhibition by diazepam and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, respectively). In the absence of GABA, pentobarbital elicited a maximal current amplitude similar to that of GABA. A minor population of channels is expressed which is open in the absence of GABA or pentobarbital. Mapping subunit gene expression by in situ hybridization histochemistry suggests that the alpha 1-, beta 1-, and gamma 2-subunits are likely receptor constituents in some neuronal populations, e.g., mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus and cerebellum.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Chromogranin/secretogranins are a family of acidic, soluble proteins with a widespread distribution in secretory vesicles of endocrine and nervous tissues. The effects of experimental stimuli of differing duration and intensity on chromogranin B and secretogranin II mRNA levels in relevant areas of the rat brain were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry using 35S-labelled oligonucleotides. Effects of two 'chronic stimulation' paradigms were studied - the effect of 4 days of water or food deprivation on mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and the effect of unilateral cervical vagotomy on transcript levels in the dorsal vagal complex 1, 2 and 7 days after surgery. After 4 days of water deprivation secretogranin II mRNA was significantly increased in supraoptic nucleus (366 +/- 21% of control, P < 0.01), the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus (209 +/- 20% of control, P < 0.01) and the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (147 +/- 6% of control, P < 0. 05) after 4 days of food deprivation. Seven days after unilateral cervical vagotomy, secretogranin II and chromogranin B mRNA levels were markedly decreased in the ipsilateral dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (25 +/- 4 and 47 +/- 8% of contralateral values respectively, P < 0.01). Rapid changes in chromogranin mRNA were also detected following shorter duration 'acute stimulation' - in the hypothalamus after hypertonic saline injection, in the hippocampus after electrical stimulation-induced kindled seizures, and in the cerebral cortex after unilateral craniotomy. A large increase in secretogranin II mRNA was detected in the supraoptic nucleus (202 +/- 25% of control, P < 0.01) and the magnocellular paraventricular nucleus (168 +/- 29% of control, P < 0.05) 3 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of hypertonic (1.8 M) saline. Markedly increased levels of secretogranin II (125-160% of control) and chromogranin B (140-230% of control) mRNA were observed in granule cells of the dentate gyrus 0.5-2 h after amygdaloid stimulation-induced seizures. A moderate increase in secretogranin II mRNA (144 +/- 11% of contralateral side, P < 0.01) was found in the underlying cerebral cortex 2.5 h after unilateral craniotomy. These results indicate that measurement of changes in chromogranin mRNA, particularly secretogranin II, is a useful means of assessing both rapid and long-lasting increases and decreases in neuronal activity and, in contrast to immediate early gene mRNA levels, may better reflect specific changes in neuronal secretory activity associated with transmitter/peptide release.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Rapid expression of ICER (inducible cyclic AMP early repressor), an inducible member of the CREM (cyclic AMP response element modulator) family of transcription factors, has been reported in neuroendocrine tissues and cell lines, but not in brain. In the present study, we demonstrate that acute electro-convulsive seizure (ECS) increases the expression of ICER in several rat brain regions. RNase protection analysis demonstrated that 1-2 h after administration of ECS, levels of mRNA for ICER and a splice variant, ICER gamma, were significantly increased in hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. It is surprising that ECS also increased levels of mRNA for several CREM isoforms that previous studies have reported were not rapidly inducible. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed these findings and demonstrated that ECS induction of ICER was most obvious in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of hippocampus and deep layers of cerebral cortex. Induction of ICER and CREM was accompanied by increased expression of two small CRE-binding complexes. Gel supershift analysis with CREM/ICER antisera confirmed that the inducible CRE-binding complexes contain CREM/ICER. Induction of CREM and ICER may contribute to negative feedback regulation of gene transcription that is increased by acute seizure and activation of CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'GABAA-receptors, the major synaptic targets for the neurotransmitter GABA, are gated chloride channels. By their allosteric drug-induced modulation they serve as molecular control elements through which the levels of anxiety, vigilance, muscle tension and epileptiform activity can be regulated. Despite their functional prominence, the structural requirements of fully functional GABAA-receptors are still elusive. Expression of cDNAs coding for the alpha 1- beta 1-subunits of rat brain yielded GABA-gated chloride channels which were modulated by barbiturates but displayed only agonistic responses to ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor. GABAA-receptors with fully functional benzodiazepine receptor sites were formed when the alpha 1- and beta 1-subunits were co-expressed with the gamma 2-subunit of rat brain. These receptors, however, failed to show cooperativity of GABA in gating the channel. In order to determine the subunit repertoire available for receptor assembly in different neuronal populations in vivo, the sites of subunit gene expression were (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, alpha 6, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2) mapped by in situ hybridization histochemistry in brain sections. The mRNAs of the alpha 1-, beta 1- and gamma 2-subunits were co-localized e.g. in mitral cells of olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of hippocampus as well as granule cells of dentate gyrus and cerebellum. The lack of colocalization in various other brain areas points to an extensive receptor heterogeneity. The presence of multiple GABAA-receptors in brain may contribute to synaptic plasticity, differential responsiveness of neurons to GABA and to variations in drug profiles.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, a high degree of coexpression of the functional 5-HT3A subunit of the 5-HT3 receptor and the central CB1 cannabinoid receptor was detected in all subfields of the hippocampus and subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). Semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated that, depending on the hippocampal layer, 72-88% of CB1-expressing interneurons coexpress the 5-HT3A subunit. Within the DG, 5-HT3A/CB1 double-labeled neurons were confined to the subgranular layer, where close to 80% of all CB1-expressing basket neurons were found to contain 5-HT3A subunit transcripts. These results provide the first evidence indicating that the only ion channel receptor for serotonin and central CB1 cannabinoid receptor coexist in neurons containing the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These findings suggest possible interactions between the cannabinoid and serotonergic systems at the level of GABA neurotransmission. However, activation of 5-HT3- or CB1-receptors are likely to have opposing regulatory effects on GABA neurotransmission, as 5-HT3 receptor activation by serotonin results in the release of GABA, while CB1 activation by cannabinoids results in inhibition of GABA release.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Multiple voltage-gated potassium (K) channel gene products are likely to be involved in regulating neuronal excitability of any single neuron in the mammalian brain. Here we show that two closely related voltage-gated K channel proteins, mKv1.1 and mKv1.2, are present in multiple subcellular locations including cell somata, juxta-paranodal regions of myelinated axons, synaptic terminals, unmyelinated axons, specialized junctions among axons, and proximal dendrites. Staining patterns of the two channel polypeptides overlap in some areas of the brain, yet each has a unique pattern of expression. For example, in the hippocampus, both mKv1.1 and mKv1.2 proteins are present in axons, often near or at synaptic terminals in the middle molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, while only mKv1.1 is detected in axons and synaptic terminals in the hilar/CA3 region. In the cerebellum, both channel proteins are localized to axon terminals and specialized junctions among axons in the plexus region of basket cells. Strong differential staining is observed in the olfactory bulb, where mKv1.2 is localized to cell somata and axons, as well as to proximal dendrites of the mitral cells. This overlapping yet differential pattern of expression and specific subcellular localization may contribute to the unique profile of excitability displayed by a particular neuron.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampus is required for short-term memory and contains both excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. These cells exhibit various forms of synaptic plasticity, the mechanism underlying learning and memory. More recently, endocannabinoids were identified to be involved in synaptic plasticity. Our goal was to describe the distribution of endocannabinoid biosynthetic enzymes within CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons and CA3/CA1 pyramidal cells. We extracted mRNA from single interneurons and pyramidal cells and used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of 12-lipoxygenase, N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D, diacylglycerol lipase α, and type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, all known to be involved in endocannabinoid production and plasticity. We observed that the expression of endocannabinoid biosynthetic enzyme mRNA does occur within interneurons and that it is coexpressed with type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, suggesting interneurons have the potential to produce endocannabinoids. We also identified that CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells express endocannabinoid biosynthetic enzyme mRNA. Our data provide the first molecular biological evidence for putative endocannabinoid production in interneurons, suggesting their potential ability to regulate endocannabinoid-mediated processes, such as synaptic plasticity.',\n",

The current report presents data from single cell RT-PCR that further reveals mRNA in CA1 cells that corresponds to the sequence of an IKCa channel from transmembrane segments 5 through 6 including the pore region, revealing the established binding sites for 4 different IKCa channel blockers. A comparison of methods to internally apply the IKCa channel blocker TRAM-34 shows that including the drug in an electrode from the onset of an experiment is unviable given the speed of drug action upon gaining access for whole-cell recordings. Together the data firmly establish IKCa channel expression in CA1 neurons and clarify methodological requirements to obtain a block of IKCa channel activity through internal application of TRAM-34.

       "  'Abstract': \"The P2 family of receptors for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is involved in several neuronal and glial cell functions in the central nervous system (CNS), and impaired function of these receptors is associated with both neuronal and glial dysfunction. Using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis, we examined the expression profiles of P2 subtype receptors in the rat hippocampus following treatment with the neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT). Among the subtypes, P2X₁ exhibited a unique profile, with an increase in expression prior to the onset of cell death after TMT administration, and a gradual decrease thereafter in neuronal cells in the rat hippocampus. This expression pattern was similar to that of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) following TMT administration. The P2X₁ antagonist NF499 strongly prevented neuronal cell death induced by TMT in the CA1 region, and successfully suppressed locomotor hyperreactivity. Furthermore, NF449 administration also inhibited COX-2 expression in the CA1 region on day 3 following TMT treatment, whereas no change was observed in the CA3. These findings suggest that P2X₁ plays a primary role in TMT-induced neuronal cell death in the CA1 region.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) using the selective beta-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) facilitates pyramidal cell long-term potentiation in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the rat hippocampus. We have previously analyzed beta-AR genomic expression patterns of 17 CA1 pyramidal cells using single cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating that all samples expressed the beta2-AR transcript, with four of the 17 cells additionally expressing mRNA for the beta1-AR subtype. However, it has not been determined which beta-AR subtypes are functionally expressed in CA1 for these same pyramidal neurons. Using cell-attached recordings, we tested the ability of ISO to increase pyramidal cell action potential (AP) frequency in the presence of subtype-selective beta-AR antagonists. ICI-118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol] and butoxamine [alpha-[1-(t-butylamino)ethyl]-2,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol) hydrochloride], agents that selectively block the beta2-AR, produced significant parallel rightward shifts in the concentration-response curves for ISO. From these curves, apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K(b)) values of 0.3 nM for ICI-118,551 and 355 nM for butoxamine were calculated using Schild regression analysis. Conversely, effective concentrations of the selective beta1-AR antagonists CGP 20712A [(+/-)-2-hydroxy-5-[2-([2-hydroxy-3-(4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy)propyl]amino)ethoxy]-benzamide methanesulfonate] and atenolol [4-[2'-hydroxy-3'-(isopropyl-amino)propoxy]phenylacetamide] did not significantly affect the pyramidal cell response to ISO. However, at higher concentrations, atenolol significantly decreased the potency for ISO-mediated AP frequencies. From these curves, an apparent atenolol K(b) value of 3162 nM was calculated. This pharmacological profile for subtype-selective beta-AR antagonists indicates that beta2-AR activation is mediating the increased AP frequency. Knowledge of functional AR expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons will aid future long-term potentiation studies by allowing selective manipulation of specific beta-AR subtypes.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the present study, we observed changes of aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in the hippocampus induced by 5 min of ischemia in gerbils. In sham-operated animals, weak AQP9 immunoreactivity was detected in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus. AQP9 immunoreactivity, and its protein level in the CA1 region began to increase significantly at 6 hr and peaked 24 hr after ischemia. In the CA2/3 region, AQP9 immunoreactivity significantly increased at 12 hr after ischemia. Thereafter, AQP9 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus decreased continuously with time. From 4 days after ischemia, AQP9 immunoreactivity in the CA1 region was expressed and increased in glial components in the strata oriens and radiatum. Based on double-immunofluorescence staining, many AQP9-immunoreactive glial cells in the CA1 region were identified as astrocytes. In a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction study, AQP9 mRNA levels significantly increased in the CA1 region at 6 hr after ischemia, and thereafter AQP9 mRNA levels decreased with time after ischemia. In addition, the water content in the gerbil hippocampus was highest 3 hr after ischemia/reperfusion; thereafter, water content in the ischemic hippocampus was higher than that in the sham-operated group. This result shows how AQP9 in the gerbil hippocampus changes in neurons and is expressed in astrocytes before and after delayed neuronal death, respectively, after ischemia. These results indicate that changes in AQP9 in ischemic CA1 pyramidal cells may be related to delayed neuronal death and that the expression of AQP9 in astrocytes is related to gliosis in the CA1 region after transient forebrain ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Differential expression of TASK channels between horizontal interneurons and pyramidal cells of rat hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Among the electrophysiological properties differentiating stratum oriens horizontal interneurons from pyramidal neurons of the CA1 hippocampal subfield are the more depolarized resting potential and the higher input resistance; additionally, these interneurons are also less sensitive to ischemic damage than pyramidal cells. A differential expression of pH-sensitive leakage potassium channels (TASK) could contribute to all of these differences. To test this hypothesis, we studied the expression and properties of TASK channels in the two cell types. Electrophysiological recordings from acute slices showed that barium- and bupivacaine-sensitive TASK currents were detectable in pyramidal cells but not in interneurons and that extracellular acidification caused a much stronger depolarization in pyramidal cells than in interneurons. This pyramidal cell depolarization was paralleled by an increase of the input resistance, suggesting the blockade of a background conductance. Single-cell reverse transcription-PCR experiments showed that the expression profile of TASK channels differ between the two cell types and suggested that these channels mediate an important share of the leakage current of pyramidal cells. We suggest that the different expression of TASK channels in these cell types contribute to their electrophysiological differences and may result in cell-specific sensitivity to extracellular acidification in conditions such as epilepsy and ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of G‑protein‑coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) in long‑term 17β‑estradiol (E2) deprivation (LTED) in a rat model with global cerebral ischemia (GCI), and its therapeutic target for ischemic stroke in the clinical setting. Following bilateral ovariectomy, GCI was induced in rats 1 or 10\\xa0weeks post‑surgery. To determine the protein and mRNA expression levels of GPR30 in the hippocampal CA1 region of LTED rats, short‑term E2 deprivation (STED) rats and naturally aging rats, western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2 treatment revealed significant neuroprotection post‑GCI in STED rats, but not in LTED rats, as well as a decrease in the expression levels of GPR30 in the hippocampal CA1 region. In LTED rats,. Notably, no effects were observed on the ubiquitination of GPR30 following investigation in STED or LTED rats. While the protein and mRNA expression levels of GPR30 were also decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of female 24‑month‑old rats compared with 3‑month‑old rats. E2 treatment initiated for the entire ovariectomy period elevated GPR30 mRNA and protein expression levels, and attenuated the loss of hippocampal neurons in the GCI‑induced CA1 region, indicating that E2 treatment exerted robust neuroprotection within LTED rats. However, the neuroprotective effect of E2 may be blocked by G15. The results of the present study revealed that downregulation of GPR30 expression may attenuate the neuroprotection of E2 within LTED conditions in rats post‑ovariectomy by leading to neuronal insensitivity to E2 neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia. These results provide evidence that GPR30 may have potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of clinical ischemic stroke.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Accumulation of mutant ubiquitin-B (UBB(+1)) in neurons is considered the hallmark of proteasomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders, however no such evidence in ischemic brain has been reported. We investigated the contribution of UBB(+1) in delayed neuronal death after transient global ischemia. Transient global ischemia was achieved by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 5 min and reperfusion in male Mongolian gerbils (n=6 per each time point). In the CA1 region, UBB(+1) immunoreactivity appeared in the cytoplasm of pyramidal cells at 30 min post-ischemia, and the density of these neurons increased at day 2 (P<0.001) and further increased at day 4 post-ischemia. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive (apoptotic) cells appeared selectively in the CA1 region at day 3 and their density increased further at day 4 post-ischemia (P<0.001). In contrast, UBB(+1) immunoreactivity was only transiently detected from 30 min to 1 day post-ischemia in CA3, dentate gyrus, and frontal cortex, but disappeared at day 2 post-ischemia. No TUNEL-positive cells were observed in these three regions. UBB(+1) mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in every region of the hippocampus and frontal cortex of ischemic gerbils and even in the non-ischemic control animals, and its expression level was independent of brain region and time after ischemia. Our results indicate induction and selective accumulation of UBB(+1) protein in dying neurons of the CA1 region and suggest that UBB(+1) expression may be induced by proteasomal dysfunction after transient global ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of iontophoretically induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents (INMDA) in CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from 1- to 40-day-old rats were used to characterize developmental changes in the Mg2+ sensitivity of NMDA receptors. 2. The dose-response relations for extracellular Mg2+ blockade of INMDA indicated a high affinity binding of Mg2+ to NMDA receptors at membrane potentials more negative than -60 mV, independent of postnatal age. 3. Depolarizing the cells unblocked NMDA receptors by decreasing their affinity for Mg2+. The efficacy of depolarization in unblocking NMDA receptors markedly increased after postnatal day 4 (P4), endowing the receptors with a greater voltage dependence. 4. The NR2B subunit-specific NMDA antagonist ifenprodil reduced INMDA in pyramidal cells of all ages. The sensitivity of INMDA to ifenprodil was greatest during the first postnatal week and decreased thereafter, indicating an enhanced contribution of NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors to INMDA in the first week after birth. 5. In the first postnatal week, the ifenprodil-insensitive INMDA component had a lower voltage dependence than the total INMDA. In older pyramidal cells, the voltage dependence of the ifenprodil-insensitive component and the total INMDA were similar. 6. In another set of CA1 pyramidal cells, single-cell reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to characterize concomitant developmental changes in NMDA subunit mRNA expression. The mRNA for the NR2D subunit was detected during the first postnatal week in 50 % of the cells and disappeared thereafter. The proportion of cells expressing the NR2A and NR2B subunits remained relatively constant throughout the first five postnatal weeks. 7. We conclude that NMDA receptors in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are effectively blocked by Mg2+ at all ages. After 4 days they become much less sensitive to Mg2+ at depolarized membrane potentials. This postnatal switch in voltage control of Mg2+ binding to NMDA receptors may be due to the downregulation of NR2D subunit expression in developing CA1 pyramidal cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The expression of several inflammatory cytokines that inhibit synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory is higher in the brains of aged mice compared to young adults after peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study we investigated whether the exaggerated inflammatory cytokine response in the hippocampus of aged mice after IP injection of LPS is associated with architectural changes to dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the dorsal CA1 hippocampus. Compared to young adults, aged mice had higher basal expression of MHC class II, lower basal expression of two neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and a decrease in total dendritic length in both the basal and apical tree. After IP LPS administration, expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha mRNA was higher in hippocampus of aged mice compared to young adults whereas NGF and BDNF mRNA was reduced similarly in both age groups. The basal dendritic tree was not affected by LPS in either adult or aged mice 72h after treatment; however, length and branching of the apical tree was reduced by LPS in aged but not adult mice. The present findings indicate that a peripheral infection in the aged can cause a heightened inflammatory cytokine response in the hippocampus and atrophy of hippocampal neurons. Architectural changes to dorsal CA1 hippocampal neurons may contribute to cognitive disorders evident in elderly patients with an infection.',\n",

The immunoreactivity for C3 was found in glial cells in control rats, and such glial cells were increased in number after KA injection. Our confocal study showed that C3-positive glial cells were microglia. Three to seven days after KA, C3 immunoreactivity appeared in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. Double staining for C3 combined with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling showed that occurrence of C3 immunoreactivity in neurons coincided well with that of DNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR experiments suggested local synthesis of C3 by brain cells.

Here, we identified protein and gene expression of chemokine receptor 6 in the hippocampus of Swiss mice with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR respectively. Immunohistochemical study showed that CCR6 immunopositive product was localized in different subtypes of hippocampal interneurons, in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons of CA1 area and other laminas of the hippocampus. Strongly stained CCR6 immunopositive product was found in calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin immunopositive interneurons in the stratum oriens of CA1 area. During pilocarpine induced status epilepticus, a transient down-regulation of neuronal CCR6 in the stratum oriens of CA1 was demonstrated at 2h during status epilepticus. The present study provides evidence that CCR6 may be involved in normal neuronal activity in the hippocampus and play an important role in maintenance of the status epilepticus.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Fat-mass and obesity-associated protein (Fto) is highly expressed in the brain including, the hippocampus, and its expression is significantly decreased in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. In the present study, we measured Fto immunoreactivity and protein levels in the hippocampus of obese and aged mice, which were induced by high-fat diet for 12\\u2009weeks and D-galactose treatment for 10\\u2009weeks, respectively. The obesity and aging phenotypes were assessed by physiological parameters and Morris water maze test, respectively. High fat diet fed mice showed significant increases in body weight and blood glucose levels compared to that in the control or D-galactose-induced aged mice. In addition, treatment with D-galactose significantly decreased the spatial memory. Fto immunoreactivity in the control group was mainly detected in the pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 regions and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In the hippocampus of high-fat diet-fed mice, Fto immunoreactive structures were similarly found in the hippocampus compared to that in the control group, but Fto immunoreactivity in high-fat diet-fed mice was also found in the stratum oriens and radiatum of the CA1 and CA3 regions and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. In the hippocampus of D-galactose-induced aged mice, fewer Fto immunoreactive structures were detected in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus compared to the control group. Fto mRNA and protein levels based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays were slightly increased in the hippocampus of high-fat diet-fed mice compared to that in control mice. In addition, Fto mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in the aged hippocampus compared to that in the control group. Fto protein levels are susceptible to the aging process, but not in the hippocampus of high-fat diet-induced obesity. The reduction of Fto in aged mice may be associated with reduced memory impairment in mice.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that often occurs at a slow pace yet deteriorates with time. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been demonstrated to offer novel therapeutic hope for disease treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of miR‑98 on amyloid β (Aβ)‑protein production, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction through the Notch signaling pathway by targeting hairy and enhancer of split (Hes)‑related with YRPW motif protein 2 (HEY2) in mice with AD. A total of 70 Kunming mice were obtained and subjected to behavioral assessment. The levels of oxidative stress‑related proteins glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, acetylcholinesterase and Na+‑K+‑ATP were measured. Morphological changes in brain tissue, HEY2‑positivity levels, neuronal apoptotic index (AI) and neuron mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels were also determined. Subsequently, the levels of miR‑98 and the mRNA and protein levels of HEY2, Jagged1, Notch1, Hes1, Hes5, β‑amyloid precursor protein, B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑associated X protein in tissues and hippocampal neurons were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. Finally, hippocampal neuron viability and apoptosis were determined using an MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The levels of miR‑98‑targeted HEY2 and miR‑98 were low and the levels of HEY2 were high in the AD mice. The AD mice exhibited poorer learning and memory abilities, oxidative stress function, and morphological changes of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, the AD mice exhibited increased protein levels of HEY2 and AI in the CA1 region of brain tissues with reduced mtDNA levels and dysfunctional neuronal mitochondria. miR‑98 suppressed hippocampal neuron apoptosis and promoted hippocampal neuron viability by inactivating the Notch signaling pathway via the inhibition of HEY2. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that miR‑98 reduced the production of Aβ and improved oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction through activation of the Notch signaling pathway by binding to HEY2 in AD mice.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Many neuropsychiatric conditions have a common set of neurological substrates associated with the integration of sensorimotor processing. The teneurins are a recently described family of proteins that play a significant role in visual and auditory development. Encoded on the terminal exon of the teneurin genes is a family of bioactive peptides, termed teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAP), which regulate mood-disorder associated behaviors. Thus, the teneurin-TCAP system could represent a novel neurological system underlying the origins of a number of complex neuropsychiatric conditions. However, it is not known if TCAP-1 exerts its effects as part of a direct teneurin function, whereby TCAP represents a functional region of the larger teneurin protein, or if it has an independent role, either as a splice variant or post-translational proteolytic cleavage product of teneurin. In this study, we show that TCAP-1 can be transcribed as a smaller mRNA transcript. After translation, further processing yields a smaller 15 kDa protein containing the TCAP-1 region. In the mouse hippocampus, immunoreactive (ir) TCAP-1 is exclusively localized to the pyramidal layers of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions. Although the localization of TCAP and teneurin in hippocampal regions is similar, they are distinct within the cell as most ir-teneurin is found at the plasma membrane, whereas ir-TCAP-1 is predominantly found in the cytosol. Moreover, in mouse embryonic hippocampal cell culture, FITC-labeled TCAP-1 binds to the plasma membrane and is taken up into the cytosol via dynamin-dependent caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Our data provides novel evidence that TCAP-1 is structurally and functionally distinct from the larger teneurins.',\n",

Decreased I(h) activity, as seen in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), could significantly alter the response of dendrites to theta inputs. Here we report a progressive erosion of theta resonance and phase lead in pyramidal cell dendrites during epileptogenesis in a rat model of TLE. These alterations were due to decreased I(h) availability, via a decline in HCN1/HCN2 subunit expression resulting in decreased h currents, and altered kinetics of the residual channels. This acquired HCN channelopathy thus compromises temporal coding and tuning to theta inputs in pyramidal cell dendrites. Decreased theta resonance in vitro also correlated with a reduction in theta frequency and power in vivo. We suggest that the neuronal/circuitry changes associated with TLE, including altered I(h)-dependent inductive mechanisms, can disrupt hippocampal theta function.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ca(2+) currents resistant to organic Ca(2+) channel antagonists are present in different types of central neurons. Here, we describe the properties of such currents in CA1 neurons acutely dissociated from rat hippocampus. Blocker-resistant Ca(2+) currents were isolated by combined application of N-, P/Q- and L-type Ca(2+) current antagonists (omega-conotoxin GVIA 2 microM; omega-conotoxin MVIIC 3 microM; omega-agatoxin IVA 200 nM; nifedipine 10 microM) and constituted approximately 21% of the total Ba(2+) current. The blocker-resistant current showed properties similar to R-type currents in other cell types, i.e. voltages of half-maximal inactivation and activation of -76 and -17 mV, respectively, and strong inactivation during the test pulse. In addition, blocker-resistant Ca(2+) currents in CA1 neurons displayed a characteristically rapid deactivation. Application of mock action potentials revealed that charge transfer through blocker-resistant Ca(2+) channels is highly sensitive to action potential shape and changes in resting membrane voltage. Pharmacological experiments showed that these currents were highly sensitive to the divalent cation Ni(2+) (half-maximal block at 28 microM), but were relatively resistant to the spider toxin SNX-482 (8% and 52% block at 0.1 and 1 microM, respectively). In addition to the functional analysis, we examined the expression of pore-forming and accessory Ca(2+) channel subunits on the messenger RNA level in isolated CA1 neurons using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the pore-forming alpha subunits encoding high-threshold Ca(2+) channels, Ca(v)2.1, Ca(v)2.2 and Ca(v)2.3 messenger RNA levels were most prominent, corresponding to the high proportion of N-, P/Q- and R-type currents in these neurons. In summary, CA1 neurons display blocker-resistant Ca(2+) currents with distinctive biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to R-type currents in other neuron types, and express Ca(2+) channel messenger RNAs that give rise to R-type Ca(2+) currents in expression systems.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Acquisition of highly efficient neural differentiation based on understanding of initial lineage commitment of human embryonic stem (hES) cells remains a challenge. This study describes a simple three-stage protocol to induce hES cells into neural lineage cells using a 2-week coculture with murine bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) PA6 followed by a 2-week propagation culture in PA6-conditioned medium and an additional 2-week selection culture in chemically defined neurobasal medium. This protocol generated a relatively high yield of neural lineage cells without mesodermal and endodermal lineage cell contamination. Notably, we demonstrated that PA6 coculture can significantly enhance the expression level of Notch signaling components and promote neural lineage entry of hES cell derivatives. Manipulation of Notch signaling can boost or suppress neural differentiation of hES cell derivatives, suggesting that Notch signaling may underlie the PA6-mediated neural induction. In vivo studies demonstrated that derived neural cells could improve the cognitive function of ischemic stroke rats. Intrastriatal human neural cell grafts were noted to migrate to damaged cerebral regions, enhance basic fibroblast growth factor production in the hippocampus, and restore the pyramidal neuron density and morphology in the hippocampal CA1 region, although only a small number of human donor cells were present in the hippocampus, suggesting that donor cells can boost hippocampal reconstruction by promoting the endogenous regeneration process. These findings demonstrate a pivotal role for Notch in hES cell fate determination and that manipulation of Notch signaling is therefore likely to be a key factor in taking command of hES cell lineage choice. This study suggested the potential of utilizing PA6 coculture to imitate the embryonic niche for hES cell neural induction via Notch signaling and a high application potential of BMSC-involved protocol, which can yield a whole lineage of human neural cells to promote endogenous regeneration in the hippocampus upon transplantation for potential therapy of ischemic stroke.

       "  'Abstract': 'Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) exerts a neuroprotective action against ischemic damage. This action is mediated by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway. However, as the expression patterns of PACAP receptors and IL-6 following ischemia are not understood, we evaluated them in the mouse hippocampus in response to ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Real-time PCR determination of PAC1R mRNA expression in the hippocampus was significantly elevated on day 7 after ischemia. VPAC1R mRNA expression was significantly decreased 3 days after the ischemic episode, while VPAC2R mRNA expression showed a nonsignificant tendency to increase on day 7. IL-6 mRNA expression was significantly increased on day 3 and peaked on day 7 after ischemia. The mRNA expression of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, which is a neuroprotective factor stimulated by PACAP, remained virtually unchanged in response to ischemia. IL-6 immunoreactivity was detected in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN on day 1 after ischemia. On day 3, irregularly shaped IL-6-immunopositive cells colocalized with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein but not with the microglial marker Iba1. PAC1R immunoreactivity co-labeled with IL-6 immunoreactivity. These results suggest that PACAP could stimulate IL-6 secretion by neurons during the acute phase after an ischemic episode and thereafter by astrocytes during the subacute phase.',\n",

Here we demonstrate that hippocampal CRH neurons represent a novel subtype of interneurons in the hippocampus, exhibiting unique morphology, electrophysiological properties, molecular markers, and connectivity. This subset of hippocampal CRH neurons in the mouse reside in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and tract tracing studies using AAV-Flex-ChR2-tdTomato reveal dense back-projections of these neurons onto principal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. These hippocampal CRH neurons express both GABA and GAD67 and using in vitro optogenetic techniques, we demonstrate that these neurons make functional connections and release GABA onto CA3 principal neurons. The location, morphology, and importantly the functional connectivity of these neurons demonstrate that hippocampal CRH neurons represent a unique subtype of hippocampal interneurons.

       "  'Abstract': 'Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons undergo delayed neurodegeneration after transient forebrain ischemia, and the phenomenon is dependent upon hyperactivation of l-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors, resulting in aberrant intracellular calcium influx. The GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors is critical in limiting the influx of calcium. The CA1 pyramidal neurons are very sensitive to ischemic damage and attempts to achieve neuroprotection, mediated by drugs, have been unsuccessful. Moreover, receptor antagonism strategies in the past have failed to provide long-term protection against ischemic injury. Long-term protection against severe forebrain ischemia can be conferred by fimbria-fornix (FF) deafferentation, which interrupts the afferent input to CA1. Our study evaluated the long-term protective effect of FF deafferentation, 12 days prior to induction of ischemia, on vulnerable CA1 neurons. Our results indicate that at 7 and 28 days post-ischemia, prior FF deafferentation protected 60% of neurons against ischemic cell death. Furthermore, we sought to evaluate whether FF deafferentation also sustained GluR2 levels in these neurons. GluR2 protein and mRNA expression were sustained by deafferentation at 70% of control following ischemia. Correlation studies revealed a positive correlation between GluR2 protein and mRNA level. These results demonstrate that protection conferred by FF deafferentation was long-term and related to sustained GluR2 expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Ischemic brain injury is not uncommon after open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and seriously undermines the patients' life quality. Therefore, potential protective effects of limb ischemic preconditioning (LIP) on subsequent ischemic injury of the brain were investigated by evaluating anti-inflammatory effects and apoptosis of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampus. One hundred and eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group (n=54) and the LIP group (n=54). A thread was used to occlude the middle cerebral artery in the MCAO group and the LIP group animals were pretreated with LIP followed by MCAO. In the two groups, nine samples were collected at each time-point of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after MCAO to detect IL-6 and IL-17 and their mRNA levels. Neurological severity scores (NSS) were examined before the animals were sacrificed. Compared with the LIP group, cerebral histopathological changes in the MCAO group were most distinct and significantly more infiltrated inflammatory and apoptotic neuronal cells were observed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-surgery. IL-17 and IL-6 mRNA levels analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) were significantly reduced in the LIP group compared with the MCAO group at the 12, 24 and 48 h time-points. A significant reduction in IL-17 expression level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the LIP group at 12, 24 and 48 h, while IL-6 was significantly reduced at the 24 and 48 h time-points. The NSSs were not significantly different between the groups. Therefore, in a MCAO rat model, we have proved that LIP pretreatment can protect the brain from infarction after ischemic injury and induce ischemic tolerance, potentially, by reducing IL-17 to provide anti-inflammatory effects and attenuate apoptosis of hippocampal neuronal cells. \",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are reported to mediate the effects of retinoid acid and participate in the maintenance of normal hippocampal function during embryonic and postnatal stages. RARalpha is the only one that has been reported to be continuously expressed among RARs in the CA1-CA3 areas of the hippocampus, at both the mRNA and the protein level. Here, we show the expression and subcellular localization of RARalpha in granule and pyramidal cells in various regions of the hippocampus during postnatal development of rats. We discovered that the expression level of RARalpha in postnatal hippocampal tissue gradually decreased over time with increasing developmental maturity of the nervous system. Moreover, the subcellular localization of RARalpha expression showed a phenomenon of intracellular translocation during the postnatal development period. This new discovery is inconsistent with a traditional viewpoint according to which RARalpha, as a nuclear transcription factor, is mainly expressed inside nucleus. This phenomenon suggests that RARalpha may have different actions during each stage of hippocampal development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Area CA1 of the rodent hippocampus is characterized by a highly lamina-specific and nonoverlapping termination of afferent fiber tracts. Entorhinal fibers terminate in stratum lacunosum-moleculare and commissural/associational fibers terminate in strata radiatum and oriens. It has been hypothesized that this fiber lamination depends on specific signals for the different afferent fiber tracts that are located on distinct dendritic segments of the postsynaptic neuron. In order to test this hypothesis, entorhinal and commissural/associational afferents to Ammon's horn were investigated in the adult reeler mutant mouse, in which developmental cell migration defects have disrupted the normal array of cells. Golgi staining revealed a deep and a superficial principal cell layer in the mutant. The morphology of the cells located in the deep pyramidal cell layer was considerably abnormal, whereas most cells located in the superficial pyramidal cell layer showed an almost normal cellular and dendritic morphology. Anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin revealed that the duplication and disorganization of the pyramidal cell layer in area CA1 are mirrored by the duplication and disruption of afferent fiber termination zones. In the zone above the abnormal deep pyramidal cell layer, i.e., between the two cell layers, entorhinal fibers as well as commissural/associational fibers terminate and intermingle. In contrast, in the zone above the fairly normal superficial pyramidal cell layer, entorhinal and commissural/associational fibers retain their normal fiber segregation. These data suggest that the normal laminar organization of the murine hippocampus depends on positional cues presented by their target cells.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'GPR35 activation reduces Ca2+ transients and contributes to the kynurenic acid-dependent reduction of synaptic activity at CA3-CA1 synapses.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Limited information is available on the brain expression and role of GPR35, a Gi/o coupled receptor activated by kynurenic acid (KYNA). In mouse cultured astrocytes, we detected GPR35 transcript using RT-PCR and we found that KYNA (0.1 to 100 µM) decreased forskolin (FRSK)-induced cAMP production (p<0.05). Both CID2745687 (3 µM, CID), a recently described GPR35 antagonist, and GPR35 gene silencing significantly prevented the action of KYNA on FRSK-induced cAMP production. In these cultures, we then evaluated whether GPR35 activation was able to modulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i ) and [Ca(2+)]i fluxes. We found that both KYNA and zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor and GPR35 agonist, did not modify either basal or peaks of [Ca(2+)]i induced by challenging the cells with ATP (30 µM). However, the [Ca(2+)]i plateau phase following peak was significantly attenuated by these compounds in a store-operated Ca(2+) channel (SOC)-independent manner. The activation of GPR35 by KYNA and zaprinast was also studied at the CA3-CA1 synapse in the rat hippocampus. Evoked excitatory post synaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices. The action of KYNA on GPR35 was pharmacologically isolated by using NMDA and α7 nicotinic receptor blockers and resulted in a significant reduction of eEPSC amplitude. This effect was prevented in the presence of CID. Moreover, zaprinast reduced eEPSC amplitude in a PDE5- and cGMP-independent mechanism, thus suggesting that glutamatergic transmission in this area is modulated by GPR35. In conclusion, GPR35 is expressed in cultured astrocytes and its activation modulates cAMP production and [Ca(2+)]i. GPR35 activation may contribute to KYNA effects on the previously reported decrease of brain extracellular glutamate levels and reduction of excitatory transmission. ',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chronic stress-induced anxiety disorder is a highly-prevalent, modern social disease in which oxidative stress plays an important role. It is necessary to determine the underlying mechanisms governing this disorder to establish an effective treatment target for anxiety disorders. In this study, we examined the behavioral changes in mice subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS). We found that CMS exposure leads to anxiety-like phenotypes and increased levels of oxidative stress in the ventral hippocampus of mice. Furthermore, CMS increased the excitatory synaptic transmission of pyramidal cells in the ventral CA1 (vCA1). Administration of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone (apocynin), an inhibitor of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, clearly ameliorated the changes induced by CMS exposure. In addition, our results of behavioral tests and analyses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using NOX2-deficient mice indicate that CMS-induced enhanced oxidative stress level is primarily caused by the increased expression of NOX2. NOX2-derived oxidative stress can serve as a target for anxiety therapy led by chronic stress.',\n",

In the postnatal month 1 (PM 1) group, c-myb immunoreactivity was detected in non-pyramidal neurons of the strata oriens and radiatum as well as in pyramidal neurons of the stratum pyramidale. At PM 3, c-myb immunoreactivity and its protein level were similar to those at PM 1. Thereafter, c-myb immunoreactivity and its protein level were increased with time. In the PM 24 group, c-myb immunoreactivity, its protein and mRNA levels were highest.

       "  'Abstract': 'The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway may represent an endogenous anti-convulsant in the rodent hippocampus although its exact contribution requires some clarification. In mouse hippocampal slices, the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in the absence of external Mg(2+)(0 Mg(2+)) produces both ictal and interictal activity followed by a prolonged period of repetitive interictal activity. In this model, we demonstrated that exogenous VEGF has clear effects on ictal and interictal activity as it reduces the duration of ictal-like events, but decreases the frequency and intensity of interictal discharges. VEGF affects epileptiform activity through its receptor VEGFR-2. We also demonstrated for the first time that the synaptic action of VEGF in the hippocampus is through VEGFR-2-mediated effects on NMDA and GABA(B) receptors and that VEGF does not affect the NMDA excytatory postsynaptic potential paired-pulse facilitation ratio. Exogenous VEGF does not affect the AMPA-mediated responses and the dendritic or the somatic GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. In addition, VEGF drastically reduces 0 Mg(2+)/4-AP-induced glutamate release through VEGFR-2 activation. In vitro epileptiform activity is sufficient to increase hippocampal expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2, and this up-regulation may serve a neuroprotective and/or anti-convulsant role. VEGFR-2 up-regulation has been localized to the CA1 region, which suggests that VEGF signalling may protect CA1 pyramidal cells from hyperexcitability. These results indicate that VEGF controls epileptic activity by influencing both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and further advance our understanding of the conditions required for endogenous VEGF up-regulation, and the mechanisms by which VEGF achieves an anti-convulsant effect.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines play important roles in responses to stresses and affect iron metabolism. Iron is essential for survival of hippocampus neurons and plays a role in depression. Noting the close causal effect relation between stress and depression, in this experimental study we investigated the influence of iron on stress-induced depression. Rats were exposed to chronic mild stress and were treated with three different iron doses (9, 12, and 20mg/kg) three times a week for four weeks with an iron chelator in the first and third week. Serum interleukin-6 (enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay), hippocampus iron content (atomic absorption spectrometry), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression (real-time polymerase chain reaction), CA1 pyramidal cell count (Nissl method) and a behavioral test (forced swimming test) were evaluated. In both the stressed and stressed plus iron groups, hippocampus cell counts were lower than in the control group (non-stressed). The use of deferiprone in the stressed groups markedly prevented neuronal loss. In stressed rats, the iron content of the hippocampus was higher than in the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, in the stressed group with moderate iron administration (12 mg/kg), there was a significant elevation of BDNF expression (P<0.05) and decreased immobility behavior time (P<0.05). These results indicate that high doses of iron in stressful situations augment neuronal degeneration and loss, possibly by iron accumulation. Deferiprone as an iron chelator could reverse this effect. During chronic mild stress, cerebrospinal fluid possibly reduces the iron content and may result in reduction of monoamines being involved in mood regulation. Iron administration in a moderate dose can increase these neurotransmitters and BDNF expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have examined gating and pharmacological characteristics of somatic K+ channels in fast-spiking interneurons and regularly spiking principal neurons of hippocampal slices. In nucleated patches isolated from basket cells of the dentate gyrus, a fast delayed rectifier K+ current component that was highly sensitive to tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations <0.1 mM) predominated, contributing an average of 58% to the total K+ current in these cells. By contrast, in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region a rapidly inactivating A-type K+ current component that was TEA-resistant prevailed, contributing 61% to the total K+ current. Both types of neurons also showed small amounts of the K+ current component mainly found in the other type of neuron and, in addition, a slow delayed rectifier K+ current component with intermediate properties (slow inactivation, intermediate sensitivity to TEA). Single-cell RT-PCR analysis of mRNA revealed that Kv3 (Kv3.1, Kv3.2) subunit transcripts were expressed in almost all (89%) of the interneurons but only in 17% of the pyramidal neurons. In contrast, Kv4 (Kv4.2, Kv4.3) subunit mRNAs were present in 87% of pyramidal neurons but only in 55% of interneurons. Selective block of fast delayed rectifier K+ channels, presumably assembled from Kv3 subunits, by 4-AP reduced substantially the action potential frequency in interneurons. These results indicate that the differential expression of Kv3 and Kv4 subunits shapes the action potential phenotypes of principal neurons and interneurons in the cortex.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"1. The Ca2+ permeability of non-NMDA and NMDA receptor channels was studied using a fluorometric flux measurement approach in somata and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurones in rat hippocampal slices. For this purpose, the Ca2+ fraction of the total cation current (named 'fractional Ca2+ current') was measured directly from the change in the Ca(2+)-sensitive fura-2 fluorescence at 380 nm excitation wavelength. 2. The fractional Ca2+ current through the somatic NMDA receptor channels was 10.69 +/- 2.13% (mean +/- S.D.) and that through dendritic receptor channels was 10.70 +/- 1.96%. The fractional Ca2+ current was not dependent on the extracellular Mg2+ concentration and its voltage dependence was in agreement with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation. 3. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate) or kainate applications produced small but significant Ca2+ entry. Fractional Ca2+ currents of 0.58 +/- 0.34% were measured for somatic AMPA applications, 0.68 +/- 0.20% for somatic kainate applications, 0.66 +/- 0.25% for dendritic AMPA applications and 0.61 +/- 0.16% for dendritic kainate applications. 4. The expression pattern of glutamate receptor subunits encoding messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) was analysed with the single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach applied to CA1 pyramidal neurones. The AMPA receptor subunits GluR-A, GluR-B and GluR-C, and the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B were found to be abundantly expressed in all CA1 pyramidal neurones tested. 5. This study establishes the fractional Ca2+ current through somatic and dendritic NMDA and non-NMDA receptor channels in CA1 pyramidal neurones. The dendritic, presumably synaptic, NMDA receptor channels are highly Ca2+ permeable and have a fractional Ca2+ current closely resembling that of somatic extrasynaptic NMDA receptor channels. Both somatic and dendritic non-NMDA receptor channels are of the 'low Ca2+ permeable' type and have a fractional Ca2+ current that is about twenty times smaller than that of NMDA receptor channels.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The CA1 region of the rat hippocampus exhibits both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor (AR) responses, however, the specific AR subtypes involved and the neuronal expression patterns for these receptors are not well understood. We have employed single cell real time RT-PCR in conjunction with cell-specific immunohistochemical markers to determine the AR expression patterns for hippocampal neurons located in CA1, a region often implicated in learning and memory processes. Cytoplasmic samples were taken from 55 individual cells located in stratum oriens, pyramidale, or radiatum and reverse transcribed. All successfully amplified pyramidal neuron samples (n = 17) expressed mRNA for the beta2AR, with four cells additionally expressing mRNA for the beta1AR subtype. Positive interneurons from stratum oriens (n = 10) and stratum radiatum (n = 8) expressed mRNA for the alpha1A and/or alpha(1B)AR (n = 9/18) only when coexpressing transcripts for somatostatin. Interneurons containing neuropeptide Y or cholecystokinin (n = 9/18) were not positive for any of the nine AR subtypes, suggesting that CA1 interneuron AR expression is limited to a subset of somatostatin-positive cells. These findings suggest that only a select number of AR subtypes are transcriptionally expressed in CA1 and that these receptors are selective to specific neuronal cell types.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The neuroprotective effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor activation was investigated in organotypic mouse hippocampal slice cultures exposed to the glutamate receptor agonist alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). Exposure of 2-week-old slice cultures, derived from 7-day-old C57BL/6 mice, to 8 microm AMPA, for 24 h, induced degeneration of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells, as measured by cellular uptake of propidium iodide (PI). A significant neuroprotection, with a reduction of PI uptake in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers, was observed after incubation with a Y(2) receptor agonist [NPY(13-36), 300 nm]. This effect was sensitive to the presence of the selective Y(2) receptor antagonist (BIIE0246, 1 microm), but was not affected by addition of TrkB-Fc or by a neutralizing antibody against brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Moreover, addition of a Y(1) receptor antagonist (BIBP3226, 1 microm) or a NPY-neutralizing antibody helped to disclose a neuroprotective role of endogenous NPY in CA1 region. Cultures exposed to 8 microm AMPA for 24 h, displayed, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a significant increase in BDNF. In such cultures there was an up-regulation of neuronal TrkB immunoreactivity, as well as the presence of BDNF-immunoreactive microglial cells at sites of injury. Thus, an increase of AMPA-receptor mediated neurodegeneration, in the mouse hippocampus, was prevented by neuroprotective pathways activated by NPY receptors (Y(1) and Y(2)), which can be affected by BDNF released by microglia and neurons.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. The distribution of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) was investigated in four cell types in hippocampal slices prepared from 10- to 13-day-old rats: CA1 pyramidal cells, interneurones of stratum radiatum in CA1, complex glial cells of the same area and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. The neuronal cell types were identified visually and characterized by the shapes and patterns of their action potentials and by neurobiotin labelling. 2. The patch-clamp technique was used to study the sensitivity of whole-cell currents to diazoxide (0.3 mM), a KATP channel opener, and to tolbutamide (0.5 mM) or glibenclamide (20 microM), two KATP channel inhibitors. The fraction of cells in which whole-cell currents were activated by diazoxide and inhibited by tolbutamide was 26% of pyramidal cells, 89 % of interneurones, 100% of glial cells and 89% of granule cells. The reversal potential of the diazoxide-induced current was at the K+ equilibrium potential and a similar current activated spontaneously when cells were dialysed with an ATP-free pipette solution. 3. Using the single-cell RT-PCR method, the presence of mRNA encoding KATP channel subunits (Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1 and SUR2) was examined in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurones. Subunit mRNA combinations that can result in functional KATP channels (Kir6.1 together with SUR1, Kir6.2 together with SUR1 or SUR2) were detected in only 17% of the pyramidal cells. On the other hand, KATP channels may be formed in 75% of the interneurones, mainly by the combination of Kir6.2 with SUR1 (58% of all interneurones). 4. The results of these combined analyses indicate that functional KATP channels are present in principal neurones, interneurones and glial cells of the rat hippocampus, but at highly different densities in the four cell types studied.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Mild hypothermia protects against neuronal damage after transient global ischemia in experimental animals. The exact mechanism of this protective effect remains to be elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms relevant to different neurologic responses to hypothermia and normothermia. Transient global ischemia was induced in C57BL/6 mice by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 10 min. Hypothermia provided robust neuroprotection in the hippocampus region and dramatically reduced the mortality rate. Using adaptor-tagged competitive polymerase chain reaction, we obtained the relative transcription levels of 1210 genes in the hippocampal region and compared the expression patterns of these genes. Two genes, Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and CUG-binding protein-2 (Cugbp2), showed remarkable and persistent increases in their expression levels in normothermic mice, compared with in both sham and hypothermic mice. Despite the increased transcription of Arc and Cugbp2, an immunohistochemistry analysis did not show comparable increases in the translations of both genes. Only a transient increase in Arc protein was observed in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus at 6 h after reperfusion. A remarkable decrease in Cugbp2 protein was observed in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1-CA3, in accordance with the progress of neuronal degeneration. A decrease in Cugbp2 protein was not observed in hypothermic mice. These results suggest that transient global ischemia induces the translational inhibition of genes with increased expression not in hypothermic, but in normothermic mice. Thus, translational inhibition might play an important role in the progress of neuronal injury after transient global ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Cell type-specific expression of acid-sensing ion channels in hippocampal interneurons.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), a member of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel superfamily, are widely expressed in the mammalian CNS. Accumulating evidence suggests that ASIC current density is higher in GABAergic interneurons than that in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the hippocampus. Such differential expression of ASICs in cortical networks is thought to be a key element for seizure termination. However, GABAergic interneurons are highly diverse; it is unclear whether the functional expression of ASICs differs in distinct GABAergic interneuron subtypes. Moreover, the subunit composition of ASICs in individual GABAergic interneurons remains unknown. By combining patch-clamp recording and single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, we correlated ASIC currents with their gene expression in acute rat hippocampal slices. The results yielded several surprising findings. First, ASIC current density of oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) cells in the CA1 region, a classical type of dendrite-targeting interneuron, is 6 times greater than that of fast-spiking basket cells (BCs) in the dentate gyrus, a major class of soma-targeting interneuron. Second, the recovery of ASICs from desensitization is slowest in BCs, intermediate in PNs, and fastest in O-LM cells. Third, the tarantula venom psalmotoxin 1, the specific blocker for ASIC1a homomers, inhibits ASIC currents in BCs but not in O-LM cells. Finally, single-cell RT-PCR analysis reveals coexpression of ASIC1a and ASIC2 subunit transcripts in O-LM cells, whereas only ASIC1a subunit transcript is detected in most BCs. Thus, differential expression of ASICs in inhibitory microcircuits likely contributes to the distinct roles of GABAergic interneurons in normal physiology and pathophysiology.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CKAMP44, identified here by a proteomic approach, is a brain-specific type I transmembrane protein that associates with AMPA receptors in synaptic spines. CKAMP44 expressed in Xenopus oocytes reduced GluA1- and A2-mediated steady-state currents, but did not affect kainate- or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents. Mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons expressed CKAMP44 at low abundance, and overexpression of CKAMP44 led to stronger and faster AMPA receptor desensitization, slower recovery from desensitization, and a reduction in the paired-pulse ratio of AMPA currents. By contrast, dentate gyrus granule cells exhibited strong CKAMP44 expression, and CKAMP44 knockout increased the paired-pulse ratio of AMPA currents in lateral and medial perforant path-granule cell synapses. CKAMP44 thus modulates short-term plasticity at specific excitatory synapses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The hippocampal formation is a plastic brain structure important for certain types of learning and memory, and also vulnerable to the effects of stress and trauma. Since hippocampal neurons express high levels of corticosteroid receptor, the morphological changes, including alterations in the size of soma, and the length and number of neurites and spines, in response to glucocorticoids released as a result of stress are intriguing. In order to highlight the morphology of neurons that express glucocorticoid receptor (GR), we have generated a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the GR promoter. We found strong green fluorescence in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 and CA2 regions and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in brain sections of the transgenic mice. GFP fluorescence was observed not only in somas, but also in neurites including both dendrites and axons. In dissociated culture, we also observed GFP fluorescence in the soma, neurites including both dendrites and axons, and dendritic spines. Microtubule-associated protein 2 immunopositive pyramidal-shaped neurons clearly showed two different populations, GFP positive and GFP negative neurons. These results indicate that this transgenic mouse line should be useful for live imaging of neuronal structure in animals as well as GR-positive cultured cells using GFP as a specific indicator.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'During development, estrogen has a variety of effects on morphological and electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also plays an important role in the survival and differentiation of neurons during development. We examined the effects of gonadectomy with and without estrogen replacement on the mRNA and protein of BDNF and its receptor, trkB, during early postnatal development of the rat hippocampus. We used immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and BDNF were localized to the same cells within the developing hippocampus. BDNF and ERalpha were colocalized in pyramidal cells of the CA3 subregion and to a lesser extent in CA1. To determine whether BDNF mRNA was regulated by estrogen during development, we gonadectomized male rat pups at postnatal day 0 (P0) and examined mRNA and protein levels from P0 to P25 using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis. After gonadectomy, BDNF mRNA levels are significantly reduced on P7, but after treatment of gonadectomized animals with estradiol benzoate on P0, levels at all ages were similar to those in intact animals. BDNF mRNA changes after gonadectomy are accompanied by an increase in the levels of BDNF protein, which were reduced by estrogen treatment at P0. We also examined the effect of postnatal estrogen treatment on trkB. There were no significant changes in trkB mRNA or protein in gonadectomized or estrogen-replaced animals. These results suggest that a direct interaction may exist between ERalpha and BDNF to alter hippocampal physiology during development in the rat.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies have shown that ethyl pyruvate (EP) acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule in several cell lines including RAW264.7 macrophages. However, the potential therapeutic value of EP for the treatment of the pathologic brain has not been investigated fully. In the present study, we examined whether EP has a beneficial effect on KA-induced neuronal cell death. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 0.94 nmol (0.2 mug) of KA produced typical neuronal cell death in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal layers of the hippocampus, and the systemic administration of EP significantly attenuated KA-induced neuronal cell death in these regions. Ethyl pyruvate was found to exert a protective effect when it was injected as late as 12 hr after KA-injection. Moreover, this EP-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by reduced levels of reactive gliosis and COX-2, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus. In addition, in passive avoidance tests, KA-induced memory impairment was improved markedly by EP. These results suggest that EP has a therapeutic potential for suppressing KA-induced pathogenesis in the brain.',\n",

In the CNS, alpha1-ARs are found in the hippocampus where animal studies have shown the ability of alpha1-AR agents to modulate long-term potentiation and memory; however, the precise distribution of alpha1-AR expression and its subtypes in the human brain is unknown making functional comparisons difficult. In the human hippocampus, 3H-prazosin (alpha1-AR antagonist) labels only the dentate gyrus (molecular, granule and polymorphic layers) and the stratum lucidum of the CA3 homogeneously. Human alpha1A-AR mRNA in the hippocampus is observed only in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, while alpha1D-AR mRNA expression is observed only in the pyramidal cell layers of CA1, CA2 and CA3, regions where 3H-prazosin did not bind. alpha1B-AR mRNA is not expressed at detectable levels in the human hippocampus.

       "  'Abstract': 'Experience-dependent modification in the electrical properties of central neurons is a form of intrinsic plasticity that occurs during development and has been observed following behavioral learning. We report a novel form of intrinsic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons mediated by the KV7/KCNQ and CaV1/L-type Ca2+ channels. Enhancing Ca2+ influx with a conditioning spike train (30 Hz, 3 s) potentiated the KV7/KCNQ channel function and led to a long-lasting, activity-dependent increase in spike frequency adaptation-a gradual reduction in the firing frequency in response to sustained excitation. These effects were abolished by specific blockers for CaV1/L-type Ca2+ channels, KV7/KCNQ channels, and protein kinase A (PKA). Considering the widespread expression of these two channel types, the influence of Ca2+ influx and subsequent activation of PKA on KV7/KCNQ channels may represent a generalized principle in fine tuning the output of central neurons that promotes stability in firing-an example of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic membrane excitability.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Acquired epilepsy (AE) is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures and long-term changes that occur in surviving neurons following an injury such as status epilepticus (SE). Long-lasting alterations in hippocampal Ca(2+) homeostasis have been observed in both in vivo and in vitro models of AE. One major regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis is the neuronal calcium binding protein, calbindin-D28k that serves to buffer and transport Ca(2+) ions. This study evaluated the expression of hippocampal calbindin levels in the rat pilocarpine model of AE. Calbindin protein expression was reduced over 50% in the hippocampus in epileptic animals. This decrease was observed in the pyramidal layer of CA1, stratum lucidum of CA3, hilus, and stratum granulosum and stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus when corrected for cell loss. Furthermore, calbindin levels in individual neurons were also significantly reduced. In addition, the expression of calbindin mRNA was decreased in epileptic animals. Time course studies demonstrated that decreased calbindin expression was initially present 1 month following pilocarpine-induced SE and lasted for up to 2 years after the initial episode of SE. The results indicate that calbindin is essentially permanently decreased in the hippocampus in AE. This decrease in hippocampal calbindin may be a major contributing factor underlying some of the plasticity changes that occur in epileptogenesis and contribute to the alterations in Ca(2+) homeostasis associated with AE.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Is the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 mRNA an early indicator of cell fate after ischemia? A quantitative single cell RT-PCR study.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'After a moderate global cerebral ischemia, two hypothetical populations of pyramidal neurons are present among the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons: one that will die and another one that will survive. Prior analysis of dissected hippocampal CA1 regions has shown a reduction of the GluR1-3 mRNA following ischemia. In order to identify these changes in single neurons, quantitative single cell RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of GluR1-4 mRNA in rats 24 h after ischemia and also in rats after tolerance inducing ischemia. Control CA1 cells had a median copy-number of 290, 247, 207 and 16 GluR1-4, respectively. The tolerant cells showed small significant up-regulations of GluR1, 3 and 4 mRNA, while the GluR2 mRNA showed a more than 4-fold up-regulation compared to control cells. All the cells from ischemic animals displayed down-regulations of GluR1-3 mRNA. The GluR4 mRNA was not detectable in the ischemic animals. Our results thus show that the CA1 neurons react uniformly 24 h after a moderate ischemia independent of the fate of the neuron: thus two neuron populations with different GluR2 profiles cannot be identified in post-ischemic animals at 24 h. It seems however that an increased level of GluR2 can be used as an indicator of tolerance to ischemia.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor I (GnRHR I) has been localized to the limbic system of the rat brain, although the functional consequences of GnRH signaling through these receptors is unknown. In this paper, we characterize the expression of GnRHR I in the human hippocampus and cortex, and the functionality of GnRHR I in human neuroblastoma cells. Robust GnRHR I immunoreactivity was detected in the cell body as well as along the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the CA2, CA1, and end plate, but was clearly lower in the subiculum of the hippocampus. Immunolabeling was also evident in cortical neurons, including those located in the entorhinal cortex and occipitotemporal gyrus but was not observed within the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. No differences in immunohistochemical staining were observed between control and Alzheimer's disease brain. GnRHR I mRNA and protein (mature, immature, and other variant) expression was detected in human neuroblastoma cells (M17, SH-SY5Y) and rat embryonic primary neurons and varied with differentiation and GnRH treatment. Since GnRHR I was expressed by extrapituitary cells, and hypothalamic GnRH I secretion markedly increases post-menopause/andropause, we treated human M17 neuroblastoma cells cultured in serum-free conditions with GnRH I for 6 h and measured LH expression. M17 neuroblastoma cells express LHbeta mRNA, while immunoblot analysis indicated the presence of three LH variants (approximately 30, 47, and 60 kDa) that were upregulated by low concentrations of GnRH I, but down-regulated at higher GnRH I concentrations. LH expression was also found to increase in differentiating embryonic rat primary cortical neurons. Our results demonstrate that neurons expressing GnRHR I are functional, responding to GnRH I by upregulating LH production. Post-reproductive surges in GnRH I secretion may explain the accumulation of LH in pyramidal neurons of the aged human and rat.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol treatment changes subunit composition, reduces synaptic function, and decreases behavioral responses to positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'One of the pharmacological targets of ethanol is the GABAA receptor (GABAR), whose function and expression are altered after chronic administration of ethanol. The details of the changes differ between experimental models. In the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) model for alcohol dependence, rats are exposed to intermittent episodes of intoxicating ethanol and withdrawal, leading to a kindling-like state of behavioral excitability. This is accompanied by presumably causal changes in GABAR expression and physiology. The present study investigates further the effect of CIE on GABAR function and expression. CIE is validated as a model for human alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) by demonstrating increased level of anxiety; diazepam improved performance in the test. In addition, CIE rats showed remarkably reduced hypnotic response to a benzodiazepine and a steroid anesthetic, reduced sensitivity to a barbiturate, but not propofol. Immunoblotting revealed decrease in alpha1 and delta expression and increase in gamma2 and alpha4 subunits in hippocampus of CIE rats, confirmed by an increase in diazepam-insensitive binding for ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo(1,5-alpha)(1,4)benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513). Elevated mRNA levels were shown for the gamma2S and gamma1 subunits. Recordings in hippocampal slices from CIE rats revealed that the decay time of GABAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells was decreased, and potentiation of mIPCSs by positive modulators of GABAR was also reduced compared with control rats. However, mIPSC potentiation by the alpha4-preferring benzodiazepine ligands bretazenil and Ro15-4513 was maintained, and increased, respectively. These data suggest that specific alterations in GABAR occur after CIE and may underlie the development of hyperexcitability and ethanol dependence.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) and prone 10 (SAMP10) are useful murine model of accelerated aging. SAMP8 shows marked impairment of learning and memory, whereas SAMP10 shows brain atrophy and aging-associated depressive behavior. This study examined the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in SAMP8 and SAMP10 brains, relative to that in SAM resistant 1 (SAMR1) controls, which age normally. Hippocampal GDNF mRNA expression decreased in an age-dependent manner (10- vs 2-month-old animals) in the SAMR1, but not in the SAMP8 or SAMP10 strains. Furthermore, GDNF mRNA expression in 2-month-old SAMP8 and SAMP10 strains was less than in SAMR1 specimens of the same age. The number of surviving neurons in the CA1 region decreased with age in SAMP8 and SAMP10, and also decreased relative to the number of neurons in 10-month-old SAMR1 controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed that cells that were positive for GDNF-like activity in 10-month-old SAMP8 and SAMP10 were diffusely distributed, in part, around the pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that low GDNF expression in young SAMP8 and SAMP10 may be involved in hippocampal dysfunctions, such as age-related learning impairment and neuronal death.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) belongs to the group of subacute spongiform encephalopathies of animals and man. Their pathogenesis is certainly related to the formation and deposition in the brain of an amyloid-type specific protein, named PrPres (prion protein-resistant). The neuropathological topography of CJD does generally admit that archicortex is relatively spared, but only a few papers have been devoted to this issue. A neuropathological study of CJD cases divided in sporadic, familial, and iatrogenic forms of the disease has been carried out, taking into consideration the archipallial lesions in relation to different clinical and neuropathological parameters. The pyramidal cell layer of CA1 of all CJD cases did not show any major loss of neurons in comparison to that observed in other cortical fields of the limbic cortex (mainly in the presubicular and entorhinal cortex) and of the neocortex. Spongiogliotic reaction was observed only in the stratum radiatum and molecularis lacunosum in a iatrogenic case of the disease. The findings observed in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 were neither related to the clinical duration of the disease nor to the severity of the lesions found in other limbic and neocortical areas. The results of this study support the view of no close relationships between the demential syndrome typically related to the clinical onset and progression of CJD, and the structural damage of the hippocampus classically involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of the amnestic syndrome related to the clinical presentation and course of more common forms of dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Progranulin haploinsufficiency is a common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the role of progranulin in the brain is poorly understood. To investigate the role of murine progranulin (Grn) in the CNS in vivo, we generated mice targeted at the progranulin locus (Grn) using a gene-trap vector. Constitutive progranulin knockout mice (GrnKO) show moderate abnormalities in anxiety-related behaviors, social interactions, motor coordination, and novel object recognition at 8months of age, many of which differ between males and females. Analysis of synaptic transmission in 10-12 month old GrnKO male mice indicates altered synaptic connectivity and impaired synaptic plasticity. Additionally, apical dendrites in pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in GrnKO males display an altered morphology and have significantly decreased spine density compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The observed changes in behavior, synaptic transmission, and neuronal morphology in GrnKO mice occur prior to neuropathological abnormalities, most of which are apparent at 18 but not at 8 months of age. We conclude that progranulin deficiency leads to reduced synaptic connectivity and impaired plasticity, which may contribute to FTD pathology in human patients.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Regional levels of prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) protein and mRNA were measured after lateral fluid percussion (FP) brain injury in rats. Immunochemical studies indicated that Par-4 immunoreactivity (ir) is present in cortical neurons and hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons in uninjured rats. Increases of Par-4-ir were observed in the CA3 neurons of the ipsilateral hippocampus (IH), but not in injured left cortex (IC) at 48 h after FP brain injury. Levels of the Par-4 mRNA measured by RT-PCR assay and protein measured by Western blot procedure were significantly increased in the injured IC and IH, but not in the contralateral right cortex and hippocampus after brain injury. Levels of both Par-4 protein and mRNA were significantly increased in the IC and IH as early as 2 h and stayed elevated at 24 and 48 h after injury. These data show that the induction of proapoptotic Par-4 mRNA and protein occurs only in the IC and IH that have been observed to undergo apoptosis and neuronal cell loss after lateral FP brain injury. Because increased expression of Par-4 has been observed to contribute to apoptosis and cell death in cultured neurons, the present temporal pattern of Par-4 expression is consistent with a role for Par-4 in apoptosis and neuronal cell death after traumatic brain injury.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Abundant distribution of TARP gamma-8 in synaptic and extrasynaptic surface of hippocampal neurons and its major role in AMPA receptor expression on spines and dendrites.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Transmembrane alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) play pivotal roles in AMPA receptor trafficking and gating. Here we examined cellular and subcellular distribution of TARP gamma-8 in the mouse brain. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence revealed the highest concentration of gamma-8 in the hippocampus. Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated dense distribution of gamma-8 on the synaptic and extrasynaptic surface of hippocampal neurons with very low intracellular labeling. Of the neuronal surface, gamma-8 was distributed at the highest level on asymmetrical synapses of pyramidal cells and interneurons, whereas their symmetrical synapses selectively lacked immunogold labeling. Then, the role of gamma-8 in AMPA receptor expression was pursued in the hippocampus using mutant mice defective in the gamma-8 gene. In the mutant cornu ammonis (CA)1 region, synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPA receptors on dendrites and spines were severely reduced to 35-37% of control levels, whereas reduction was mild for extrasynaptic receptors on somata (74%) and no significant decrease was seen for intracellular receptors within spines. In the mutant CA3 region, synaptic AMPA receptors were reduced mildly at asymmetrical synapses in the stratum radiatum (67% of control level), and showed no significant decrease at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Therefore, gamma-8 is abundantly distributed on hippocampal excitatory synapses and extrasynaptic membranes, and plays an important role in increasing the number of synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPA receptors on dendrites and spines, particularly, in the CA1 region. Variable degrees of reduction further suggest that other TARPs may also mediate this function at different potencies depending on hippocampal subregions, input sources and neuronal compartments.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased vulnerability of the aged brain to traumatic brain injury (TBI), we compared the expression of several age-related genes in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus subfields of the young and aged rat hippocampus before and after lateral fluid percussion TBI. Using laser capture microdissection (LCM), we obtained hippocampal neurons and glia from the neuropil adjacent to the pyramidal and granule cell layers. Subsequently, we linearly amplified and analyzed the antisense mRNA using Northern blot and ribonuclease protection assays (RPA). Our procedures, which have not been previously applied to quantitative analysis of LCM mRNA from neural tissue, included a modified reverse transcription step to enhance full-length cDNA synthesis, thus enhancing the yield of larger components of in vitro-transcribed mRNA for downstream analysis. Northern analysis showed greater expression of two aging-associated genes, p21 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the aged hippocampus. The age-related differences in p21 and BDNF expression were particularly prominent after TBI. By quantitative RPA analysis, we found that the expression of p21, known to be induced in senescent cells, was significantly greater in the CA3 region of aged rats, an area that is selectively vulnerable to TBI. However, expression of genes associated with regenerative and repair functions was significantly decreased in aged hippocampus. Our RPA results indicate that substantial age-dependent differences in the transcriptional profile of distinct regions of the hippocampal formation may account, in part, for their differential susceptibility to brain injury.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The molecular and functional properties of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were characterized from CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal slices using single-cell reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in conjunction with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We analysed the presence of the neuronal nAChR subunit mRNAs alpha2-7 and beta2-4, along with the mRNA for the GABAergic markers GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) 65 and 67 isoforms, and VGAT (vesicular GABA transporter) in interneurons from the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens, and in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Functional nAChR-mediated currents were detected in both interneuron populations, but not in pyramidal neurons. The neuronal nAChR subunit mRNAs detected in > 20 % of the populations examined were alpha4, alpha5, alpha7 and beta2-4 in stratum radiatum interneurons; alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha7, beta2 and beta3 subunits in stratum oriens interneurons; and beta2-4 in pyramidal neurons. High levels of GABAergic marker mRNAs were detected in both interneuron populations, but not in pyramidal neurons. Significant co-expression of nAChR subunits within individual neurons was detected for alpha3 + alpha5, alpha4 + beta2, alpha4 + beta3, alpha7 + beta2, beta2 + beta3 and beta3 + beta4. The kinetics of the nAChR-mediated currents in response to the application of 100 microM ACh were significantly correlated with the expression of particular nAChR subunits. The alpha3, alpha7 and beta2 nAChR subunits were individually correlated with a fast rise time, the alpha2 nAChR subunit was correlated with a medium rise time, and the alpha4 nAChR subunit was correlated with a slow rise time. The alpha2 and alpha4 nAChR subunits were also significantly correlated with slow desensitization kinetics.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Blockade of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors protects hippocampal neurons against global ischemia-induced death.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Transient global or forebrain ischemia induced experimentally in animals can cause selective, delayed neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. A striking feature is a delayed rise in intracellular free Zn(2+) in CA1 neurons just before the onset of histologically detectable cell death. Here we show that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses in postischemic hippocampus exhibit properties of Ca(2+)/Zn(2+)-permeable, Glu receptor 2 (GluR2)-lacking AMPARs before the rise in Zn(2+) and cell death. At 42 h after ischemia, AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents exhibited pronounced inward rectification and marked sensitivity to 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine (Naspm), a selective channel blocker of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. In control hippocampus, AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents were electrically linear and relatively insensitive to Naspm. Naspm injected intrahippocampally at 9-40 h after insult greatly reduced the late rise in intracellular free Zn(2+) in postischemic CA1 neurons and afforded partial protection against ischemia-induced cell death. These results implicate GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors in the ischemia-induced rise in free Zn(2+) and death of CA1 neurons, although a direct action at the time of the rise in Zn(2+) is unproven. This receptor subtype appears to be an important therapeutic target for intervention in ischemia-induced neuronal death in humans.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used as a therapeutic tool in neurology and psychiatry. While repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) has been shown to induce plasticity of excitatory synapses, it is unclear whether rMS can also modify structural and functional properties of inhibitory inputs. Here we employed 10-Hz rMS of entorhinohippocampal slice cultures to study plasticity of inhibitory neurotransmission on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our experiments reveal a rMS-induced reduction in GABAergic synaptic strength (2-4\\u2009h after stimulation), which is Ca(2+)-dependent and accompanied by the remodelling of postsynaptic gephyrin scaffolds. Furthermore, we present evidence that 10-Hz rMS predominantly acts on dendritic, but not somatic inhibition. Consistent with this finding, a reduction in clustered gephyrin is detected in CA1 stratum radiatum of rTMS-treated anaesthetized mice. These results disclose that rTMS induces coordinated Ca(2+)-dependent structural and functional changes of specific inhibitory postsynapses on principal neurons. ',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Various types of learning, including operant conditioning, induce an increase in cellular activation concomitant with an increase in local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU). This increase is mediated by increased cerebral blood flow or changes in brain capillary density and diameter. Because glucose transporters are ultimately responsible for glucose uptake, we examined their plastic expression in response to cellular activation. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that cerebral glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression consistently parallels changes in LCGU. The present study is the first to investigate the effect of memory processing on glucose transporters expression. Changes in GLUT expression produced by training in an operant conditioning task were measured in the brain of CD1 mice. Using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real time RT-PCR the cerebral GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression was quantified immediately, 220 min and 24 h following training. Relative to sham-trained and naive controls, operant conditioning training induced an immediate increase in GLUT1 immunoreactivity level in the hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells as well as in the sensorimotor cortex. At longer post-learning delays, GLUT1 immunoreactivity decreased in the sensorimotor cortex and putamen. Parallel to the changes in protein levels, hippocampus GLUT1 mRNA level also increased immediately following learning. No effect of learning was found on hippocampal GLUT3 protein or mRNA expression. Measures of changes in glucose transporters expression present a link between cellular activation and glucose metabolism. The learning-induced localized increases in GLUT1 protein as well as mRNA levels observed in the present study confirm the previous findings that GLUT1 expression is plastic and respond to changes in cellular metabolic demands.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Cell-type-specific splicing of KChIP4 mRNA correlates with slower kinetics of A-type current.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'In neurons, rapidly inactivating A-type potassium currents regulate repetitive firing and sensitivity to synaptic inputs both in the soma and in the dendrites. It has been established that Kv4 family subunits with several modifying proteins such as KChIPs are responsible for A-type current in most neurons. However, it is not clear which of these modifying proteins are responsible for the observed difference in the properties of A-type currents in the neurons. For example, in globus pallidus (GP) and basal forebrain (BF) neurons in rats, A-type current possesses a slowly inactivating (tau > 80 ms) component of inactivation that is absent in the currents obtained from striatal cholinergic interneurons (StrI) and hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal neurons (HIP). It has been shown that KChIP4 splice variant A but not splice variant B can increase inactivation rates of Kv4 current to > 100 ms in Xenopus oocytes. We tested the hypothesis that cell-specific expression of KChIP4A is responsible for the slow inactivation of A-type current in these neurons. Employing single-cell RT-PCR in acutely dissociated rat neurons, KChIP4A mRNA was detected in 12/14 GP cells and in 12/14 BF neurons whereas it was not detected in any StrI or HIP cells. By contrast, the KChIP4 splice variant B was detected in all four types of cells. Moreover, deactivation rates at -100 mV were slower in BF and GP cells than in StrI and HIP neurons as expected, owing to the presence KChIP4A in BF and GP neurons. These data are consistent with our initial hypothesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline and accumulation of neurotoxic oligomeric peptides amyloid-β (Aβ). Although the molecular events are not entirely known, it has become evident that inflammation, environmental and other risk factors may play a causal, disruptive and/or protective role in the development of AD. The present study investigated the ability of the chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), the respective ligands for chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4, to suppress Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment with MIP-2 or SDF-1α significantly protected neurons from Aβ-induced dendritic regression and apoptosis in vitro through activation of Akt, ERK1/2 and maintenance of metalloproteinase ADAM17 especially with SDF-1α. Intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ led to reduction in dendritic length and spine density of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and increased oxidative damage 24h following the exposure. The Aβ-induced morphometric changes of neurons and increase in biomarkers of oxidative damage, F(2)-isoprostanes, were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the chemokines MIP-2 or SDF-1α. Additionally, MIP-2 or SDF-1α was able to suppress the aberrant mislocalization of p21-activated kinase (PAK), one of the proteins involved in the maintenance of dendritic spines. Furthermore, MIP-2 also protected neurons against Aβ neurotoxicity in CXCR2-/- mice, potentially through observed up regulation of CXCR1 mRNA. Understanding the neuroprotective potential of chemokines is crucial in defining the role for their employment during the early stages of neurodegeneration.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Potential therapeutic effects of Oct-4-positive rat umbilical cord matrix (RUCM) cells in treating cerebral global ischemia were evaluated using a reproducible model of cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation in rats. Animals were randomly assigned to four groups: A, sham-operated; B, 8-minute CA without pretreatment; C, 8-minute CA pretreated with defined media; and D, 8-minute CA pretreated with Oct-4(+) RUCM cells. Pretreatment was done 3 days before CA by 2.5-microl microinjection of defined media or approximately 10(4) Oct-4(+) RUCM cells in left thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, corpus callosum, and cortex. Damage was assessed histologically 7 days after CA and was quantified by the percentage of injured neurons in hippocampal CA1 regions. Little damage (approximately 3%-4%) was found in the sham group, whereas 50%-68% CA1 pyramidal neurons were injured in groups B and C. Pretreatment with Oct-4(+) RUCM cells significantly (p < .001) reduced neuronal loss to 25%-32%. Although the transplanted cells were found to have survived in the brain with significant migration, few were found directly in CA1. Therefore, transdifferentiation and fusion with host cells cannot be the predominant mechanisms for the observed protection. The Oct-4(+) RUCM cells might repair nonfocal tissue damage by an extracellular signaling mechanism. Treating cerebral global ischemia with umbilical cord matrix cells seems promising and worthy of further investigation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'M-type K(+) currents (I(K(M))) play a key role in regulating neuronal excitability. In sympathetic neurons, M-channels are thought to be composed of a heteromeric assembly of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 K(+) channel subunits. Here, we have tried to identify the KCNQ subunits that are involved in the generation of I(K(M)) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons cultured from 5- to 7-day-old rats. RT-PCR of either CA1 or CA3 regions revealed the presence of KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 subunits. Single-cell PCR of dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons gave detectable signals for only KCNQ2, KCNQ3 and KCNQ5; where tested, most also expressed mRNA for the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1. Staining for KCNQ2 and KCNQ5 protein showed punctate fluorescence on both the somata and dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Staining for KCNQ3 was diffusely distributed whereas KCNQ4 was undetectable. In perforated patch recordings, linopirdine, a specific M-channel blocker, fully inhibited I(K(M)) with an IC(50) of 3.6 +/- 1.5 microM. In 70 % of these cells, TEA fully suppressed I(K(M)) with an IC(50) of 0.7 +/- 0.1 mM. In the remaining cells, TEA maximally reduced I(K(M)) by only 59.7 +/- 5.2 % with an IC(50) of 1.4 +/- 0.3 mM; residual I(K(M)) was abolished by linopirdine. Our data suggest that KCNQ2, KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 subunits contribute to I(K(M)) in these neurons and that the variations in TEA sensitivity may reflect differential expression of KCNQ2, KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 subunits.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ischemic stroke is the most common life-threatening neurological disease and has limited therapeutic options. One component of ischemic neuronal death is inflammation. Here we show that doxycycline and minocycline, which are broad-spectrum antibiotics and have antiinflammatory effects independent of their antimicrobial activity, protect hippocampal neurons against global ischemia in gerbils. Minocycline increased the survival of CA1 pyramidal neurons from 10.5% to 77% when the treatment was started 12 h before ischemia and to 71% when the treatment was started 30 min after ischemia. The survival with corresponding pre- and posttreatment with doxycycline was 57% and 47%, respectively. Minocycline prevented completely the ischemia-induced activation of microglia and the appearance of NADPH-diaphorase reactive cells, but did not affect induction of glial acidic fibrillary protein, a marker of astrogliosis. Minocycline treatment for 4 days resulted in a 70% reduction in mRNA induction of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme, a caspase that is induced in microglia after ischemia. Likewise, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA was attenuated by 30% in minocycline-treated animals. Our results suggest that lipid-soluble tetracyclines, doxycycline and minocycline, inhibit inflammation and are neuroprotective against ischemic stroke, even when administered after the insult. Tetracycline derivatives may have a potential use also as antiischemic compounds in humans.',\n",

We now show that the ethanol-induced increase in 3alpha,5alpha-TH PROG is more pronounced in the brain than in the plasma of isolated rats. The ability of ethanol to inhibit isoniazid-induced convulsions is greater in isolated rats than in group-housed animals and this effect is prevented by treatment with finasteride. Social isolation modified the effects of ethanol on the amounts of steroidogenic regulatory protein mRNA and protein in the brain. Moreover, ethanol increased the amplitude of GABA(A) receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurones with greater potency in hippocampal slices prepared from socially isolated rats than in those from group-housed rats, an effect inhibited by finasteride. The amounts of the alpha(4) and delta subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in the hippocampus were increased in isolated rats as were GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic inhibitory currents in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that social isolation results in changes in GABA(A) receptor expression in the brain, and in an enhancement of the stimulatory effect of ethanol on brain steroidogenesis, GABA(A) receptor function and associated behaviour.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Stress results in alterations in behavior and physiology that can be either adaptive or maladaptive. To define the molecular pathways involved in the response to stress further, we generated mice deficient (KO) in the calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclase type VIII (AC8) by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. AC8 KO mice demonstrate a compromise in calcium-stimulated AC activity in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem. Hippocampal slices derived from AC8 KO mice fail to demonstrate CA1-region long-term depression after low-frequency stimulation, and AC8 KO mice also fail to activate CRE-binding protein in the CA1 region after restraint stress. To define the behavioral consequences of AC8 deficiency, we evaluated AC8 KO mice in the elevated plus-maze and open field. Although naive AC8 KO mice exhibit indices of anxiety comparable with that of wild-type mice, AC8 KO mice do not show normal increases in behavioral markers of anxiety when subjected to repeated stress such as repetitive testing in the plus-maze or restraint preceding plus-maze testing. These results demonstrate a novel role for AC8 in the modulation of anxiety.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from visually identified hippocampal interneurones in slices of rat brain tissue in vitro. Bath application of the bombesin-like neuropeptides gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) or neuromedin B (NMB) produced a large membrane depolarization that was blocked by pre-incubation with the subtype 2 bombesin (BB2) receptor antagonist [D-Phe6, Des-Met14]bombesin-(6-14)ethyl amide. 2. The inward current elicited by NMB or GRP was unaffected by K+ channel blockade with external Ba2+ or by replacement of potassium gluconate in the electrode solution with caesium acetate. 3. Replacement of external NaCl with Tris-HCl significantly reduced the magnitude of the GRP-induced current at -60 mV. In contrast, replacement of external NaCl with LiCl had no effect on the magnitude of this current. 4. Photorelease of caged GTPgammaS inside neurones irreversibly potentiated the GRP-induced current at -60 mV. Similarly, bath application of the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 significantly reduced the size of the inward current induced by GRP. 5. Reverse transcription followed by the polymerase chain reaction using cytoplasm from single hippocampal interneurones demonstrated the expression of BB2 receptor mRNA together with glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67). 6. Although bath application of GRP or NMB had little or no effect on the resting membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal cells per se, these neuropeptides produced a dramatic increase in the number and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in these cells in a TTX-sensitive manner.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV/Gr (CaMKIV/Gr) is a key effector of neuronal Ca(2+) signaling; its function was analyzed by targeted gene disruption in mice. CaMKIV/Gr-deficient mice exhibited impaired neuronal cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and Ca(2+)/CREB-dependent gene expression. They were also deficient in two forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons and a late phase of long-term depression in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. However, despite impaired LTP and CREB activation, CaMKIV/Gr-deficient mice exhibited no obvious deficits in spatial learning and memory. These results support an important role for CaMKIV/Gr in Ca(2+)-regulated neuronal gene transcription and synaptic plasticity and suggest that the contribution of other signaling pathways may spare spatial memory of CaMKIV/Gr-deficient mice.',\n",

In the present study, we demonstrated the neural specialization of NSSR1 protein expression in humans and mice. Strong immunoreactive signals to NSSR1 were observed in mouse cerebral neurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells, pyramidal neurons in CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and granule cells in the dentate gyrus. In primarily cultured mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs), at the undifferentiated status, NSSR1 transcripts were detected, but not the proteins. In comparison, in differentiated NPCs both NSSR1 transcripts and proteins were expressed and significantly up-regulated. The results suggest that NSSR1 is important in regulation of brain function and neural differentiation, possibly via regulating the neural-specific alternative splicing of genes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In the present study, the effect of corticosterone (CORT) on the generation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and its underlying mechanism involving neurotrophin gene expression in CA1 synapses of rat hippocampal slice were examined. Our experimental results showed incubation of hippocampal slice with CORT for 3 h had no effect on either the slope or amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) evoked in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal dentrites, indicating no marked change in basal synaptic transmission. However, when tetanic stimulation (100 pulses, 100 Hz) was delivered to the Schaffer collateral pathway, CORT application significantly attenuated the tetanus-induced increases of both EPSP slope and amplitude, demonstrating an inhibitory effect of CORT on LTP generation. In addition, CORT treatment significantly reduced both slope and amplitude ratios of the second evoked EPSP to the first one when paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was established at different interpulse intervals from 20 to 40 ms, suggesting that a presynaptic mechanism may be involved in CORT-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that CORT-treated hippocampal CA1 cells underwent a significant decrease in the expression of mRNA for nerve growth factor-beta (NGF-beta) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not for neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) compared with those in control. Moreover, BDNF co-applied with CORT significantly antagonized CORT-induced deficit in PPF. Taken together, the present results suggest that CORT-induced inhibition of LTP may be, at least to some extent, mediated by a presynaptic mechanism and decrease in the BDNF expression in rat hippocampal CA1 cells induced by CORT may partially account for this presynaptic mechanism.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Chronic epileptogenic cellular alterations in the limbic system after status epilepticus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Status epilepticus (SE) is associated with both acute and permanent pathological sequellae. One common long term consequence of SE is the subsequent development of a chronic epileptic condition, with seizures frequently originating from and involving the limbic system. Following SE, many studies have demonstrated selective loss of neurons within the hilar region of the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. Selective loss of distinct subpopulations of interneurons throughout the hippocampus is also frequently evident, although interneurons as a whole are selectively spared relative to principal cells. Accompanying this loss of neurons are circuit rearrangements, the most widely studied being the sprouting of dentate granule cell (DGC) axons back onto the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, termed mossy fiber sprouting. Less studied are the receptor properties of the surviving neurons within the epileptic hippocampus following SE. DGCs in epileptic animals exhibit marked alterations in the functional and pharmacological properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. DGCs have a significantly elevated density of GABA(A) receptors in chronically epileptic animals. In addition, the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors in post-SE epileptic animals are quite different compared to controls. In particular, GABA(A) receptors in DGCs from epileptic animals show an enhanced sensitivity to blockade by zinc, and a markedly altered sensitivity to modulation by benzodiazepines. These pharmacological differences may be due to a decreased expression of alpha1 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor relative to other alpha subunits in DGCs of post-SE epileptic animals. These GABA(A) receptor alterations precede the onset of spontaneous seizures in post-SE DGCs, and so are temporally positioned to contribute to the process of epileptogenesis in the limbic system. The presence of zinc sensitive GABA receptors combined with the presence of zinc-containing \"sprouted\" mossy fiber terminals innervating the proximal dendrites of DGCs in the post-SE epileptic hippocampus prompted the development of the hypothesis that repetitive activation of the DG in the epileptic brain could result in the release of zine. This zinc in turn may diffuse to and block \"epileptic\" zinc-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in DGCs, leading to a catastrophic failure of inhibition and concomitant enhanced seizure propensity in the post-SE epileptic limbic system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The effect of histamine on N-methyl-D-aspartate currents was investigated in pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices from juvenile rats. The objective was to compare histamine effects in the slice with those previously reported in acutely dissociated and cultured hippocampal neurons. Micromolar concentrations of histamine had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents in the slice, in contrast to the large enhancement seen in culture under identical conditions. However, millimolar concentrations of histamine blocked these currents both in the slice and in culture. Possible reasons for the lack of enhancement in the slice were explored as follows. (1) Histamine could not penetrate the slice or was already present at high concentrations inside the slice. This was tested by recording N-methyl-D-aspartate currents elicited in outside-out patches pulled from the somas of CA1 slice neurons. Histamine still had no effect in patches, whereas the corresponding experiment for cultured neurons showed robust enhancement. (2) Slices release an endogenous ligand that binds with high affinity to the histamine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, blocking its activation. This was tested by superfusing cultures with supernatant from homogenized slice tissue. Histamine enhancement was maintained in these cultures. (3) CA1 slices and cultures express different N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtypes. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique was used to examine the expression of messenger RNA encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits in the two systems. No difference was found in the whole-tissue expression of messenger RNA for the NR2A, 2B or 2C subunits or for the eight known splice variants of the NR1 subunit. It is hypothesized that the differential enhancing effect of histamine in slices and culture involves posttranslational modifications or other factors that modulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor/ion channel according to its environment.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The presence of cell surface Ca2+ permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA)/kainate (Ca-A/K) channels on subsets of central neurons influences both normal physiological function and vulnerability to excitotoxicity. Factors that regulate the formation and membrane insertion of Ca-A/K channels, however, are poorly understood. Recently, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was shown to increase the cell surface expression of an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit (GluR1) and to potentiate vulnerability to AMPAR-mediated injury. In this study, we examined the possibility that TNF-alpha might also increase numbers of functional Ca-A/K channels. In acute hippocampal slice preparations, TNF-alpha appeared to increase Ca-A/K channel numbers in pyramidal neurons (HPNs), as assessed using a histochemical stain based on kainate-induced uptake of Co2+ ions (Co2+ labeling). In dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures, TNF-alpha exposure (6 nM, 15 min) induced a rapid increase in cell surface levels not only of GluR1, but also of the AMPAR subunit GluR2, on most neurons, without evident new protein synthesis. Furthermore, consistent with the slice studies, fluorescence Ca2+ imaging techniques revealed an increase in numbers of Ca-A/K channels on what appeared to be a subset of HPNs. These observations are the first to provide evidence for the rapid upregulation of neuronal Ca-A/K channels in response to a cytokine or any other soluble factor, and provide a novel mechanism through which TNF-alpha may modulate both synaptic function and neuronal vulnerability.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Reversal of Aging-Related Neuronal Ca2+ Dysregulation and Cognitive Impairment by Delivery of a Transgene Encoding FK506-Binding Protein 12.6/1b to the Hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': [\"Brain Ca2+ regulatory processes are altered during aging, disrupting neuronal, and cognitive functions. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, the Ca2+ -dependent slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) exhibits an increase with aging, which correlates with memory impairment. The increased sAHP results from elevated L-type Ca2+ channel activity and ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca2+ release, but underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Previously, we found that expression of the gene encoding FK506-binding protein 12.6/1b (FKBP1b), a small immunophilin that stabilizes RyR-mediated Ca2+ release in cardiomyocytes, declines in hippocampus of aged rats and Alzheimer's disease subjects. Additionally, knockdown/disruption of hippocampal FKBP1b in young rats augments neuronal Ca2+ responses. Here, we test the hypothesis that declining FKBP1b underlies aging-related hippocampal Ca2+ dysregulation. Using microinjection of adeno-associated viral vector bearing a transgene encoding FKBP1b into the hippocampus of aged male rats, we assessed the critical prediction that overexpressing FKBP1b should reverse Ca2+ -mediated manifestations of brain aging. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR confirmed hippocampal FKBP1b overexpression 4-6 weeks after injection. Compared to aged vector controls, aged rats overexpressing FKBP1b showed dramatic enhancement of spatial memory, which correlated with marked reduction of sAHP magnitude. Furthermore, simultaneous electrophysiological recording and Ca2+ imaging in hippocampal neurons revealed that the sAHP reduction was associated with a decrease in parallel RyR-mediated Ca2+ transients. Thus, hippocampal FKBP1b overexpression reversed key aspects of Ca2+ dysregulation and cognitive impairment in aging rats, supporting the novel hypothesis that declining FKBP1b is a molecular mechanism underlying aging-related Ca2+ dysregulation and unhealthy brain aging and pointing to FKBP1b as a potential therapeutic target.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain, and it exerts its fast hyperpolarizing effect through activation of anion (predominantly Cl-)-permeant GABA(A) receptors. However, during early neuronal development, GABA(A)-receptor-mediated responses are often depolarizing, which may be a key factor in the control of several Ca2+-dependent developmental phenomena, including neuronal proliferation, migration and targeting. To date, however, the molecular mechanism underlying this shift in neuronal electrophysiological phenotype is unknown. Here we show that, in pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus, the ontogenetic change in GABA(A)-mediated responses from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing is coupled to a developmental induction of the expression of the neuronal (Cl-)-extruding K+/Cl- co-transporter, KCC2. Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of KCC2 expression produces a marked positive shift in the reversal potential of GABAA responses in functionally mature hippocampal pyramidal neurons. These data support the conclusion that KCC2 is the main Cl- extruder to promote fast hyperpolarizing postsynaptic inhibition in the brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recording of glutamate-activated currents in membrane patches was combined with RT-PCR-mediated AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit mRNA analysis in single identified cells of rat brain slices. Analysis of AMPARs in principal neurons and interneurons of hippocampus and neocortex and in auditory relay neurons and Bergmann glial cells indicates that the GluR-B subunit in its flip version determines formation of receptors with relatively slow gating, whereas the GluR-D subunit promotes assembly of more rapidly gated receptors. The relation between Ca2+ permeability of AMPAR channels and the relative GluR-B mRNA abundance is consistent with the dominance of this subunit in determining the Ca2+ permeability of native receptors. The results suggest that differential expression of GluR-B and GluR-D subunit genes, as well as splicing and editing of their mRNAs, account for the differences in gating and Ca2+ permeability of native AMPAR channels.',\n",

It has been suggested that the selective neuronal damage induced by KA may result not only from its depolarizing actions, but also from intracellular accumulation of Ca2+. The effects of KA are mediated by specific high-affinity receptors, enriched in the hippocampus. Members of this class of receptors, GluR5 and GluR6, have been characterized by cDNA cloning. Ca2+ permeability of the GluR6 receptor is determined by editing in the corresponding RNA. We report here a rapid PCR-based approach to assess in all experimental conditions the levels of GluR5 and GluR6 editing in the transmembrane TMII region. We show that editing in both GluR5 and GluR6 RNA is developmentally regulated and that different regions of the adult rat hippocampus demonstrate distinct levels of GluR6 editing.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"We reported earlier that the levels of Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinases are increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) specimens, relative to control specimens. Here we show that these enzymes are forms of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 (EC3.4.24. 35) and are expressed in the human hippocampus. Affinity-purified antibodies to MMP-9 labeled pyramidal neurons, but not granular neurons or glial cells. MMP-9 mRNA is expressed in pyramidal neurons, as determined with digoxigenin-labeled MMP-9 riboprobes, and the presence of this mRNA is confirmed with reverse transcriptase PCR. The cellular distribution of MMP-9 is altered in AD because 76% of the total 100 kDa enzyme activity is found in the soluble fraction of control specimens, whereas only 51% is detectable in the same fraction from AD specimens. The accumulated 100 kDa enzyme from AD brain is latent and can be converted to an active form with aminophenylmercuric acetate. MMP-9 also is detected in close proximity to extracellular amyloid plaques. Because a major constituent of plaques is the 4 kDa beta-amyloid peptide, synthetic Abeta1-40 was incubated with activated MMP-9. The enzyme cleaves the peptide at several sites, predominantly at Leu34-Met35 within the membrane-spanning domain. These results establish that neurons have the capacity to synthesize MMP-9, which, on activation, may degrade extracellular substrates such as beta-amyloid. Because the latent form of MMP-9 accumulates in AD brain, it is hypothesized that the lack of enzyme activation contributes to the accumulation of insoluble beta-amyloid peptides in plaques.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'SCYL2 Protects CA3 Pyramidal Neurons from Excitotoxicity during Functional Maturation of the Mouse Hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Neuronal death caused by excessive excitatory signaling, excitotoxicity, plays a central role in neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms regulating this process, however, are still incompletely understood. Here we show that the coated vesicle-associated kinase SCYL2/CVAK104 plays a critical role for the normal functioning of the nervous system and for suppressing excitotoxicity in the developing hippocampus. Targeted disruption of Scyl2 in mice caused perinatal lethality in the vast majority of newborn mice and severe sensory-motor deficits in mice that survived to adulthood. Consistent with a neurogenic origin of these phenotypes, neuron-specific deletion of Scyl2 also caused perinatal lethality in the majority of newborn mice and severe neurological defects in adult mice. The neurological deficits in these mice were associated with the degeneration of several neuronal populations, most notably CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, which we analyzed in more detail. The loss of CA3 neurons occurred during the functional maturation of the hippocampus and was the result of a BAX-dependent apoptotic process. Excessive excitatory signaling was present at the onset of degeneration, and inhibition of excitatory signaling prevented the degeneration of CA3 neurons. Biochemical fractionation reveals that Scyl2-deficient mice have an altered composition of excitatory receptors at synapses. Our findings demonstrate an essential role for SCYL2 in regulating neuronal function and survival and suggest a role for SCYL2 in regulating excitatory signaling in the developing brain. Significance statement: Here we examine the in vivo function of SCYL2, an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein pseudokinase thought to regulate protein trafficking along the secretory pathway, and demonstrate its importance for the normal functioning of the nervous system and for suppressing excitatory signaling in the developing brain. Together with recent studies demonstrating a role of SCYL1 in preventing motor neuron degeneration, our findings clearly establish the SCY1-like family of protein pseudokinases as key regulators of neuronal function and survival.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Although of clinical importance, little is known about the mechanism of seizure in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). In the present study, we have attempted to elucidate the mechanism underlying the seizure of cathepsin D-deficient (CD-/-) mice that show a novel type of lysosomal storage disease with a phenotype resembling late infantile NCL. In hippocampal slices prepared from CD-/- mice at post-natal day (P)24, spontaneous burst discharges were recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells. At P24, the mean amplitude of IPSPs after stimulation of the mossy fibres was significantly smaller than that of wild-type mice, which was substantiated by the decreased level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents in the hippocampus measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). At this stage, activated microglia were found to accumulate in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA3 subfield of CD-/- mice. However, there was no significant change in the numerical density of GABAergic interneurons in the CA3 subfield of CD-/- mice at P24, estimated by counting the number of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 67-immunoreactive somata. In the hippocampus and the cortex of CD-/- mice at P24, some GABAergic interneurons displayed extremely high somatic granular immunoreactivites for GAD67, suggesting the lysosomal accumulation of GAD67. GAD67 levels in axon terminals abutting on to perisomatic regions of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells was not significantly changed in CD-/- mice even at P24, whereas the total protein levels of GAD67 in both the hippocampus and the cortex of CD-/- mice after P24 were significantly decreased as a result of degradation. Furthermore, the recombinant human GAD65/67 was rapidly digested by the lysosomal fraction prepared from the whole brain of wild-type and CD-/- mice. These observations strongly suggest that the reduction of GABA contents, presumably because of lysosomal degradation of GAD67 and lysosomal accumulation of its degraded forms, are responsible for the dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal CA3 subfield of CD-/- mice.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Norepinephrine has potent antiepileptic properties, the pharmacology of which is unclear. Under conditions in which GABAergic inhibition is blocked, norepinephrine reduces hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) epileptiform activity through alpha(2) adrenergic receptor (AR) activation on pyramidal cells. In this study, we investigated which alpha(2)AR subtype(s) mediates this effect. First, alpha(2)AR genomic expression patterns of 25 rat CA3 pyramidal cells were determined using real-time single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, demonstrating that 12 cells expressed alpha(2A)AR transcript; 3 of the 12 cells additionally expressed mRNA for alpha(2C)AR subtype and no cells possessing alpha(2B)AR mRNA. Hippocampal CA3 epileptiform activity was then examined using field potential recordings in brain slices. The selective alphaAR agonist 6-fluoronorepinephrine caused a reduction of CA3 epileptiform activity, as measured by decreased frequency of spontaneous epileptiform bursts. In the presence of betaAR blockade, concentration-response curves for AR agonists suggest that an alpha(2)AR mediates this response, as the rank order of potency was 5-bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine (UK-14304) >or= epinephrine >6-fluoronorepinephrine > norepinephrine >>> phenylephrine. Finally, equilibrium dissociation constants (K(b)) of selective alphaAR antagonists were functionally determined to confirm the specific alpha(2)AR subtype inhibiting CA3 epileptiform activity. Apparent K(b) values calculated for atipamezole (1.7 nM), MK-912 (4.8 nM), BRL-44408 (15 nM), yohimbine (63 nM), ARC-239 (540 nM), prazosin (4900 nM), and terazosin (5000 nM) correlated best with affinities previously determined for the alpha(2A)AR subtype (r = 0.99, slope = 1.0). These results suggest that, under conditions of impaired GABAergic inhibition, activation of alpha(2A)ARs is primarily responsible for the antiepileptic actions of norepinephrine in the rat hippocampal CA3 region.',\n",

Here, we show that membrane currents and dendritic Ca(2+) signals evoked by recombinant BDNF or an activator of diacylglycerol (DAG)-sensitive transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are impaired in CA3 pyramidal neurons of symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice. TRPC3 and TRPC6 mRNA and protein levels are lower in Mecp2 mutant hippocampus, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) identified Trpc3 as a target of MeCP2 transcriptional regulation. BDNF mRNA and protein levels are also lower in Mecp2 mutant hippocampus and dentate gyrus granule cells, which is reflected in impaired activity-dependent release of endogenous BDNF estimated from TRPC currents and dendritic Ca(2+) signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons.

       "  'Abstract': 'Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common, chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional expression of protein-coding mRNAs, which may have key roles in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. In experimental models of prolonged, injurious seizures (status epilepticus) and in human epilepsy, we found upregulation of miR-134, a brain-specific, activity-regulated miRNA that has been implicated in the control of dendritic spine morphology. Silencing of miR-134 expression in vivo using antagomirs reduced hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neuron dendrite spine density by 21% and rendered mice refractory to seizures and hippocampal injury caused by status epilepticus. Depletion of miR-134 after status epilepticus in mice reduced the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures by over 90% and mitigated the attendant pathological features of temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, silencing miR-134 exerts prolonged seizure-suppressant and neuroprotective actions; determining whether these are anticonvulsant effects or are truly antiepileptogenic effects requires additional experimentation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The RT-PCR approach was used to estimate the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) rho receptor subunits in the hippocampus of neonatal and adult rats. All three rho subunits were detected at postnatal day (P) 2, the rho3 subunit being expressed at an extremely low level. The rho1 and rho2 products appeared to be developmentally regulated; they were found to be more pronounced in adulthood. In another set of experiments, to correlate gene expression with receptor function, GABA(A) rho subunit mRNAs were detected with single-cell RT-PCR in CA3 pyramidal cells (from P3-P4 hippocampal slices), previously characterized with electrophysiological experiments for their bicuculline-sensitive or -insensitive responses to GABA. In 6 of 19 cells (31%), pressure application of GABA evoked at -70 mV inward currents that persisted in the presence of 100 microM bicuculline (314 plus minus 129 pA). RT-PCR performed in two of these neurons revealed the presence of rho1 and rho2 subunits, the latter being present with the alpha2 subunit. A rho2 subunit was also found in 1 neuron (among 9) exhibiting a response to GABA, which was completely abolished by bicuculline. This might be due to the lack of putative accessory GABA(A) subunits that can coassemble with rho2 to make functional receptors. Similar experiments from 10 P15 CA3 pyramidal cells failed to reveal any rho1-3 transcripts. However, these neurons abundantly express alpha3 subunits. It is likely that in CA3 pyramidal cells of neonatal and adult hippocampus GABA(A) rho subunits are present but at very low levels of expression.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'An orphan receptor of ligand-gated ion-channel type (L2, also termed ZAC according to the presence of zinc ion for channel activation) was identified by computer-assisted search programs on human genome database. The L2 protein shares partial homology with serotonin receptors 5HT3A and 5HT3B. We have cloned L2 cDNA derived from human caudate nucleus and characterized the exon-intron structure as follows: (1) The L2 protein has four transmembrane regions (M1-M4) and a long cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4. (2) The sequence is conserved in species including chimpanzee, dog, cow, and opossum. (3) Nine exons form its protein-coding region and especially exon 5 corresponds to a disulfide bond region on the amino-terminal side. Our analysis using multiple tissue cDNA panels revealed that at least two splicing variants of L2 mRNA are present. The cDNA PCR amplification study revealed that L2 mRNA is expressed in tissues including brain, pancreas, liver, lung, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle while 5HT3A mRNA could be detected in brain, heart, placenta, lung, kidney, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, and 5HT3B mRNA in brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle, suggesting different significance in tissue expression of these receptors. Regional expression of L2 mRNA and protein was examined in brain. The RT-PCR studies confirmed L2 mRNA expression in hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus in adult brain. The L2 protein was immunolocalized by using antipeptide antibodies. Immunostained tissue sections revealed that L2-like immunoreactivity was dominantly expressed in the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells and in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. We analyzed the expression of L2 protein in HEK293 cells using GFP fusion protein reporter system. Western blots revealed that L2 protein confers sugar chains on the extracellular side. In transfected HEK293 cells, cellular membranes and intracellular puncta were densely labeled with GFP, suggesting selective dispatch to the final destination.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Several lines of evidence suggest that hormonal changes after menopause may play an important role in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction, and also in the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated the effect of estrogen on cognitive function in rats under different stress environment. Female rats were divided into four groups: two groups were ovariectomized (OVX) and two were sham-operated. One group each of OVX and sham rats was kept in a normal environment, and the other groups were assigned to a daily restraint stress (6 h/day) for 21 days from 2 months after the operation. Following the stress period, subjects were tested for performance in novel object recognition test and then used for morphological and neurochemical analyses. The OVX plus stress (OVX/stress) group showed a significant impairment of recognition of novel objects, compared with the other groups. The OVX/stress group also showed a marked decrease in the number of pyramidal cells of the CA3 region and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the hippocampus. We further examined the effect of estrogen against cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal changes of OVX/stress rats. Vehicle or 17beta-estradiol (E2) at 20 microg/day was s.c. administered to OVX/stress rats from 2 days before the stress period to the end of behavioral analysis through an implantable osmotic pump. Chronic E2 treatment decreased stress response and improved the cognitive and morphological impairments relative to vehicle group. These data have important implications for cognition enhancing effect of estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB(1)) are highly expressed on presynaptic terminals in the brain where they are importantly involved in the control of neurotransmitter release. Alteration of CB(1) expression is associated with a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. There is now compelling evidence that peripheral inflammatory disorders are associated with depression and cognitive impairments. These can be modeled in rodents with peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but central effects of this treatment remain to be fully elucidated. As a reduction in endocannabinoid tone is thought to contribute to depression, we asked whether the expression of CB(1) in the CNS is altered following LPS treatment. CD1 mice received LPS (0.1-1mg/kg, ip) and 6h later activated microglial cells were observed only in circumventricular organs and only at the higher dose. At 24h, activated microglial cells were identified in other brain regions, including the hippocampus, a structure implicated in some mood disorders. Immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were utilized to evaluate the change of CB(1) expression 24h after inflammation. LPS induced an increase of CB(1) mRNA in the hippocampus and brainstem. Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis revealed reduced CB(1) in the hippocampus, especially in CA3 pyramidal layer. Analysis of co-localization with markers of excitatory and inhibitory terminals indicated that the decrease in CB(1) expression was restricted to glutamatergic terminals. Despite widespread microglial activation, these results suggest that peripheral LPS treatment leads to limited changes in CB(1) expression in the brain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Within the central nervous system (CNS), cytokines are though to have active roles in pathophysiological changes seen in various neurological diseases and trauma. The present study was undertaken to examine the early response of pro-inflammatory cytokines following exposure to a specific neurotoxicant (trimethyltin; TMT). mRNA levels for interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha were measured in the hippocampus of adult male Long-Evans hooded rats following an acute injection of trimethyltin hydroxide (8 mg TMT/kg body weight). At various times following exposure (6 h to 8 days), hippocampal tissues were excised and relative changes in cytokine mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and TNF alpha mRNA levels in the hippocampus increased within 6 h and remained elevated for 8 days. Quantitative analysis of mRNA transcripts revealed a two-fold increase in both IL-6 and TNF alpha within 6 h and a continued elevation of TNF alpha to 9-fold by 12 h. Within 96 h, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA levels were elevated in the hippocampus. Histological examination showed sparse individual neuronal necrosis at this time in both the pyramidal and granule cell regions with no increase in astrocyte GFAP immunoreactivity. However, an early, 24 h, response of microglial cells was indicated by increased lectin binding. This morphological profile progressed over time to a profound neuronal loss in the CA3-4 granule cell layer and marked astrocyte hypertrophy. The onset of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression appears to be temporally associated with histological evidence of elevated microglia in the hippocampus. It is proposed that microglia and pro-inflammatory cytokines play a modulatory role in the early stages of TMT-induced neurotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO; arachidonate:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.34) is the enzyme responsible for the first step in the formation of inflammatory leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. 5-LO is expressed in hippocampal neurons. Increased formation of leukotrienes was found in the hippocampus of rats in which seizures were induced by a glutamate receptor agonist, kainate. Expression of the 5-LO gene can be stimulated by vitamin D3 and suppressed by the pineal hormone melatonin. Here we hypothesize that kainate also stimulates 5-LO expression in the hippocampus. Kainate was injected intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg). Rats were sacrificed 3 hr later and their hippocampi were dissected and total RNA was extracted and processed for quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 5-LO and cyclophilin (cyc) mRNAs. Mutated primers were used as internal standards to assay attomol quantities of these two specific mRNAs per microgram of total RNA. Fixed hippocampal slices were processed for 5-LO immunostaining and Nissl staining (assay of cell damage). Kainate induced about a 2.5-fold increase in 5-LO mRNA and triggered a redistribution of 5-LO like immunoreactivity from the pyramidal cell bodies into the dendrites of these neurons, particularly in the CA3 area. The results suggest that glutamate receptor-mediated signaling may modify the expression of neuronal 5-LO and that this enzyme might be involved in glutamate receptor-mediated neuronal plasticity and/or degeneration.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The pentameric 5-HT(3) receptor complex is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates fast synaptic transmission in the brain. Expression of two subunits (5-HT(3A) and 5-HT(3B) subunits) gives rise to at least two receptor isoforms (homomeric 5-HT(3A) and heteromeric 5-HT(3A/3B) receptors), which differ in their biophysical characteristics, although expression of these proteins has not been investigated in human brain. The expression of h5-HT(3A) and 5-HT(3B) subunits in the human hippocampus was investigated using selective polyclonal antibodies (SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, immunohistochemistry), with expression of each subunit verified by PCR detection of subunit transcripts. 5-HT(3A) and 5-HT(3B) subunit immunoreactivity was identified within the human hippocampus. The cellular pattern of expression for each subunit was similar, with predominant immunoreactivity associated with pyramidal neurones in CA fields 2 and 3, and also the relatively large neurones within the hilus (CA4 field). Transcripts for each subunit were also identified in human hippocampal tissue. These findings indicate that human hippocampal neurones are capable of forming at least two, functionally different, isoforms of the 5-HT(3) receptor. Furthermore the expression pattern of 5-HT(3A) and 5-HT(3B) subunits in human hippocampus appears to differ with the rodent counterpart, which may underlie the differences in some of the behavioural effects of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists between these species.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Novel microRNA revealed by systematic analysis of the microRNA transcriptome in dentate gyrus granule cells.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Post-transcriptional control of gene expression by microRNAs provides an important regulatory system within neurons, allowing co-ordinate and fine-tuned expression of plasticity-related proteins. Indeed, specific microRNAs have been shown to be regulated by synaptic activity in the dentate gyrus, and contribute to the regulated gene expression that underlies the persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of memory. To fully explore the contribution of microRNAs in synaptic plasticity, it is important to characterize the complete microRNA transcriptome in regions such as the dentate gyrus. Accordingly we used deep sequencing and miRDeep* analysis to search for novel microRNAs expressed in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Drawing on combined sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, including hairpin stability and patterns of precursor microRNA processing, we identified nine putative novel microRNAs. We did not find evidence of differential expression of any of these putative microRNAs following LTP at perforant path-granule cell synapses in awake rats (5\\u202fh post-tetanus; p\\u202f>\\u202f0.05). Focusing on novel_miR-1, the most abundant novel miRNA, we showed that this sequence could be amplified from RNA extracted from dentate gyrus granule cells by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, by computationally predicting mRNA targets of this microRNA, we found that this novel microRNA likely contributes to the regulation of proteins that function at synapses.',\n",

Here we used chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE), 21d protracted abstinence following CIE (21d AB), and re-exposure to one vapor session during protracted abstinence (re-exposure) to evaluate the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on basal synaptic function, neuronal excitability and expression of key synaptic proteins that play a role in neuronal excitability in the medial PFC (mPFC) and dentate gyrus (DG). CIE consistently enhanced excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC and granule cell neurons in the DG. In the DG, this effect persisted during 21d AB. Re-exposure did not enhance excitability, suggesting resistance to vapor-induced effects. Analysis of action potential kinetics revealed that altered afterhyperpolarization, rise time and decay time constants are associated with the altered excitability during CIE, 21d AB and re-exposure. Molecular adaptations that may underlie increases in neuronal excitability under these different conditions were identified. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of large-conductance potassium (BK) channel subunit mRNA in PFC and DG tissue homogenates did not show altered expression patterns of BK subunits.

       "  'Abstract': 'Lead exposure has been implicated in the impairment of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) areas of rats. However, whether the degradation of physiological properties is based on the morphological alteration of granule neurons in DG areas remains elusive. Here, we examined the dendritic branch extension and spine formation of granule neurons after lead exposure during development in rats. Dendritic morphology was studied using Golgi-Cox stain method, which was followed by Sholl analysis at postnatal days 14 and 21. Our results indicated that, for both ages, lead exposure significantly decreased the total dendritic length and spine density of granule neurons in the DG of the rat hippocampus. Further branch order analysis revealed that the decrease of dendritic length was observed only at the second branch order. Moreover, there were obvious deficits in the proportion and size of mushroom-type spines. These deficits in spine formation and maturity were accompanied by a decrease in Arc/Arg3.1 expression. Our present findings are the first to show that developmental lead exposure disturbs branch and spine formation in hippocampal DG areas. Arc/Arg3.1 may have a critical role in the disruption of neuronal morphology and synaptic plasticity in lead-exposed rats.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Developmental exposure to Mn caused Mn accumulation in the brain tissue and transient disruption of granule cell neurogenesis, targeting the late stage differentiation of progenitor cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rats. Because neurogenesis is influenced by proinflammatory responses, this study was performed to determine whether Mn exposure causes microglial activation in the dentate hilus, a region anatomically close to the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Pregnant rats were treated with dietary MnCl2 · 4H2O at 32, 160 or 800 ppm from gestational day 10 to day 21 after delivery. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed increases in Iba1(+) microglia in the hilus on postnatal day 21 following exposure to MnCl2 · 4H2O in a dose-unrelated manner at 32 and at 800 ppm and an increase in CD163(+) macrophage at 800 ppm in the hilus. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed increases in the mRNA levels of Il1α, Il6, Nos2 and Tnf after 800 ppm MnCl2 · 4H2O. These results suggest that activation of microglia and perivascular macrophages occurs in the hilus after developmental exposure to MnCl2 · 4H2O at 800 ppm, and probably involves the disruption of neurogenesis through the accumulation of Mn in the brain tissue.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Aberrant Epigenetic Gene Regulation in GABAergic Interneuron Subpopulations in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus of Mouse Offspring Following Developmental Exposure to Hexachlorophene.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Maternal hexachlorophene (HCP) exposure causes transient disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis in mouse offspring. We examined epigenetically hypermethylated and downregulated genes related to this HCP-induced disrupted neurogenesis. Mated female mice were dietary exposed to 0 or 100\\u2009ppm HCP from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21 on weaning. The hippocampal dentate gyrus of male offspring was subjected to methyl-capture sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses on PND 21. Validation analyses on methylation identified three genes, Dlx4, Dmrt1, and Plcb4, showing promoter-region hypermethylation. Immunohistochemically, DLX4+, DMRT1+, and PLCB4+ cells in the dentate hilus co-expressed GAD67, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuron marker. HCP decreased all of three subpopulations as well as GAD67+ cells on PND 21. PLCB4+ cells also co-expressed the metabotropic glutamate receptor, GRM1. HCP also decreased transcript level of synaptic plasticity-related genes in the dentate gyrus and immunoreactive granule cells for synaptic plasticity-related ARC. On PND 77, all immunohistochemical cellular density changes were reversed, whereas the transcript expression of the synaptic plasticity-related genes fluctuated. Thus, HCP-exposed offspring transiently reduced the number of GABAergic interneurons. Among them, subpopulations expressing DLX4, DMRT1, or PLCB4 were transiently reduced in number through an epigenetic mechanism. Considering the role of the Dlx gene family in GABAergic interneuron migration and differentiation, the decreased number of DLX4+ cells may be responsible for reducing those GABAergic interneurons regulating neurogenesis. The effect on granule cell synaptic plasticity was sustained until the adult stage, and reduced GABAergic interneurons active in GRM1-PLCB4 signaling may be responsible for the suppression on weaning.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The organotin trimethyltin (TMT) is well known to cause neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of mice. The first purpose of the present study was to examine whether the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin could ameliorate neuronal degeneration in the dentate gyrus of mice following TMT treatment in vivo. The systemic injection into mice of TMT at 2.8 mg/kg produced activation of endogenous caspase-3 and calpain, enhanced the gene expression of COX-1 and COX-2, activated microglial cells, and caused the formation of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal in the hippocampus. Given at 12-h post-TMT treatment, the systemic injection of indomethacin (5 or 10 mg/kg, subcutaneously) significantly decreased the TMT-induced damage to neurons having active caspase-3 and single-stranded DNA in the dentate granule cell layer of the hippocampus. The results of the α-Fodrin degradation test revealed that the post-treatment with indomethacin was effective in attenuating TMT-induced activation of endogenous caspases and calpain in the hippocampus. In TMT-treated animals, interestingly, the post-treatment with indomethacin produced not only activation of microglial cells in the dentate gyrus but also the formation of 4-hydroxynonenal in the dentate granule cell layer. Taken together, our data suggest that COX inhibition by indomethacin ameliorated TMT-induced neuronal degeneration in the dentate gyrus by attenuating intensive oxidative stress.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Childhood trauma is a well-described risk factor for the development of stress-related psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression later in life. Childhood adversity can be modeled in rodents by juvenile stress (JS) protocols, resulting in impaired coping with stressful challenges in adulthood. In the current study, we investigated the long-lasting impact of JS on the expression of molecular factors for glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake and turnover in sublayers of the dentate gyrus (DG) using laser microdissection and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed reduced mRNA expression levels after JS for factors mediating astrocytic glutamate and GABA uptake and degradation. These alterations were prominently observed in the dorsal but not ventral DG granule cell layer, indicating a lasting change in astrocytic GABA and glutamate metabolism that may affect dorsal DG network activity. Indeed, we observed increased inhibition and a lack of facilitation in response to paired-pulse stimulation at short interstimulus intervals in the dorsal DG after JS, while no alterations were evident in basal synaptic transmission or forms of long-term plasticity. The shift in paired-pulse response was mimicked by pharmacologically blocking the astrocytic GABA transporter GAT-3 in naïve animals. Accordingly, reduced expression levels of GAT-3 were confirmed at the protein level in the dorsal granule cell layer of rats stressed in juvenility. Together, these data demonstrate a lasting shift in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of dorsal DG network activity by JS that appears to be mediated by decreased GABA uptake into astrocytes.',\n",

       "'In the hippocampus, the classical pyramidal cell type of the subiculum acts as a primary output, conveying hippocampal signals to a diverse suite of downstream regions. Accumulating evidence suggests that the subiculum pyramidal cell population may actually be comprised of discrete subclasses. Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments.'"
