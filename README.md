Lecture notebooks for BILD 62

## Topics covered

### Week 1: Tools, programming fundamentals, & basic Python syntax
To set the foundation for this course, we’ll introduce the tools that we will use in this class, including Jupyter Notebooks (via the DataHub). We’ll also introduce fundamental programming concepts, such as coding syntax, assigning variables, and writing expressions.

### Week 2: Data structures
Students will learn how to work with simple data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries. We’ll cover how to slice, index, and manipulate these data structures.

### Week 3: Booleans, conditionals, loops, and functions
After establishing the basics of programming in Python, students will learn how to use Booleans in their code. We’ll also introduce conditionals and the different types of loops in Python, as well as introduce Functions.

### Week 4: Object-oriented programming
Python, like many other programming languages, is object-oriented. In this week, we’ll explore classes and other implications of object-oriented programming.

### Weeks 5 & 6: Working with data: Statistics & Visualization
In these weeks, we will elaborate on the introduction to data structures (lists, tuples, and dictionaries) an introduce additional packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for running statistical analyses and visualizing data. 

### Week 7: Time series analyses
How do we perform analyses on different times of biological time series, such as electrophysiology and imaging data? Students will perform time series analyses on electrophysiology and imaging data, and learn about the various types of signal processing used for different data types. 

### Week 8: Debugging, documentation, and version control
As we move towards working on projects, it is important to introduce the ideas of properly documenting and code and using version control software.

### Week 9: Image processing in Python
We’ll introduce the various implementations of image processing in Python, e.g., for cell segmentation. We’ll discuss the fundamentals of storing images, image file types, etc.

### Week 10: Final projects
Students will be tasked with doing simple data analysis of their choosing.
